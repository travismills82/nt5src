;   This file along with update.inx are used to constuct the
;   update.inf and hotfix.inf files used by service pack
;   and hotfix install (update.exe).
;
;   The sections contained in this file are merged with the
;   update.inx file using the following utilities in order.
;
;       * C Precompiler processes and #if conditions
;       * Infmerge.exe to insert the sections into update.inf
;       * Prodfilt.exe to process platform and type conditions
;
