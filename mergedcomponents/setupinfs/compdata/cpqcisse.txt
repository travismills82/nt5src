The currently installed version of the device driver "cpqcisse.sys" does not provide support for this version of Microsoft Windows and needs to be disabled for the upgrade to continue. This driver provides event notification functionality for Smart Array 5xxx controllers. Cpqcisse.sys forwards events to the OS event log, server IMD, server IML, and Compaq Insight Manager. A new version of this driver that supports this version of Windows is available at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=380. Web addresses can change, so you might be unable to connect to this Web site.
