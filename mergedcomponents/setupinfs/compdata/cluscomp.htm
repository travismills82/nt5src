<P>
Setup detected that the Cluster Service is installed. To properly upgrade a Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0 Server Cluster, you must upgrade one node at a time with the other node powered off (rolling upgrade is not supported). To properly upgrade a Windows&nbsp;2000 Server Cluster node, the Cluster Service must be running on that node.  All nodes in the Cluster must be Windows&nbsp;2000 or later to maintain interoperability in a mixed-version Server Cluster.
