<P>Setup has detected that the Active Directory forest and domain need to be prepared for Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2003.</P>

<p><B>Description</B></p>
<UL>
<LI>The forest and domains are prepared by using the <B>adprep</B> command on the schema operations master and infrastructure operations master, respectively. </LI>
<LI>This domain controller is the schema operations master. </LI>
<LI>To prepare the Active Directory forest and domains, perform the following procedures in the order provided.</LI> 
</UL>

<p><B>To prepare an Active Directory forest for Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2003</B></p>

<OL>
<LI>To exit Setup, click <B>Next</B>, click <B>Finish</B>, and then click <B>Exit</B>.</LI>

<LI>At a command prompt, change to the \I386 directory, and then type:
   
  <blockquote><B>adprep /forestprep</B></blockquote>

<P>When prompted, type <B>C</B>, and then press <B>ENTER</B> to begin forest preparation, or type any other key, and then press <B>ENTER</B> to cancel. </P>
</LI>

<LI>After the forest preparation data has replicated throughout the forest, prepare the domains for Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2003 as described in the following procedure. The domain preparation operation must be performed on the infrastructure operations master of each domain in the forest.

<p><B>To prepare an Active Directory domain for Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2003</B></p>

<OL>
<LI>On the domain controller holding the infrastructure operations master role, insert or connect to the installation media.
</LI>
<LI>If the splash screen opens, click <B>Exit</B>.</LI>

<LI>At a command prompt, change to the \I386 directory on the installation media, and then type: 
   
<blockquote><B>adprep /domainprep </B></blockquote>

<p>If the command is run on a domain controller other than the current operations master, the name of the current operations master is displayed. In this case, repeat steps 1 through 3 on the current operations master.</p>
</LI>

<LI>After the domain preparation data has replicated throughout the domain, upgrade the domain controller by running Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2003 Setup (I386\winnt32.exe on the installation media). 
</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Notes</B></P>
<UL><LI>You cannot upgrade domain controllers in a forest without first preparing the forest and domains by using <B>adprep</B> on the schema and infrastructure operations masters, respectively. </LI>
<LI>Depending on the replication schedule for your organization, the time it takes to propagate preparation data will vary.</LI>
