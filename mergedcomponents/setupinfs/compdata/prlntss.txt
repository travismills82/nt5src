The currently installed version of the device driver "prlntss.sys" does not provide support for Windows Server 2003 and needs to be disabled for the upgrade to continue. This driver provides event notification functionality for Proliant Storage Systems when connected to a Compaq SCSI adapter. PRLNTSS.SYS forwards events to the OS event log, server IMD, server IML, and Compaq Insight Manager. A new version of this driver that supports Windows Server 2003 is available at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=380.
