Microsoft Windows Setup has detected Windows NT 4.0 basic volumes in your computer. These volumes might include basic spanned, mirrored, striped, or RAID-5 volumes.

You must convert these volumes to dynamic before installing this version of Windows. Use Disk Administrator to convert basic disks that contain a portion of a Windows NT 4.0 basic volume to dynamic.
