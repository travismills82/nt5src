Microsoft Windows Setup has detected that you have the Routing and Remote Access Service configured. If you choose to continue with the upgrade, the number of VPN ports configured will be limited to 1,000 each for PPTP and L2TP. In addition, the number of concurrent VPN connections allowed by the Routing and Remote Access Service will be limited to 1,000. This limitation is for the Standard edition of Windows Server 2003 only.

If you require support for greater than 1,000 concurrent VPN connections, please upgrade to the Enterprise or Datacenter edition.
