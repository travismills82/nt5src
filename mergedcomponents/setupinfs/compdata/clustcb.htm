<P>Setup detected that the Cluster service is already installed on this server. This version of Windows requires that the Cluster Service Account be granted the &quot;Act as part of the operating system&quot; user right. Setup determined that the Cluster Service Account does not have that right. You must grant the &quot;Act as part of the operating system&quot; right to the account, then restart Setup to continue upgrading this node in the cluster.</P>

<P>
For security reasons, you must grant this user right to the specific account that is used by the Cluster Server service. You cannot correct this problem by granting the user right to a security group of which the service account is a member. Typically, you must grant this user right as a local user right; it cannot be a domain-level user right. However, if your node is a domain controller, you can use the domain level user right.</P>

<P>For more information on setting user rights, refer to &quot;To edit a security setting&quot; in the Windows&nbsp;2000 help documentation, or on Windows&nbsp;NT&nbsp;4.0, open User Manager for Domains, click the <B>Help</B> menu in User Manager, and refer to &quot;Managing the User Rights Policy.&quot;</P>
