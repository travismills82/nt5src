Setup has detected that the Active Directory domain needs to be prepared for Windows Server 2003. 

Description: 

-The domain is prepared by using the adprep command on the infrastructure operations master. 

-This domain controller is the infrastructure operations master for this domain. 


To prepare an Active Directory domain for Windows Server 2003: 

1. To exit Setup, click Next, click Finish, and then click Exit.

2. At a command prompt, change to the \I386 directory on the installation media, and then type: 

    adprep /domainprep 

3. After the domain preparation data has replicated throughout the domain, upgrade the domain controller by running Windows Server 2003 Setup (I386\winnt32.exe on the installation media). 


Notes: 

-You cannot upgrade domain controllers in a forest without first preparing the forest and domains by using adprep on the schema and infrastructure operations masters, respectively. 

-Depending on the replication schedule for your organization, the time it takes to propagate preparation data will vary.
