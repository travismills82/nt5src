<P>
The version of IAS in Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2003, Standard Edition,
cannot support more than 50 RADIUS clients (for example, Microsoft Routing and
RAS server or Cisco Wireless Access Points can be configured as a RADIUS
client). However, the version of IAS in Windows&nbsp;2000 Server installed on
this computer is configured to support more than 50 RADIUS clients. </P>

<P>
If you continue, the new version of IAS will be installed, but it will not
start unless you delete some of the RADIUS clients. To continue supporting more
than 50 RADIUS clients, install Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2003, Enterprise
Edition.
