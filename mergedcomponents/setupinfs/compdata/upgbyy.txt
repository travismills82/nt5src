This printer will not function properly under this version of Microsoft Windows using the printer driver that is currently installed.

You can replace the driver with an updated version before proceeding, or Windows Setup will install a compatible driver.

To replace the driver with an updated version, do one of the following:

* Install a set of Microsoft-supplied drivers (recommended) from your Windows CD. In the CD's Printers folder, double-click Fixprnsv, and then double-click Fixprnsv.exe. This utility will install updated drivers to support Windows NT 4.0 clients. Windows Setup will automatically install updated drivers for your Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 clients when you complete the upgrade.

* Obtain a more recent version of this printer driver by contacting the printer manufacturer.
