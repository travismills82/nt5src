This computer is running the Microsoft Site Server Internet Locator Service (ILS). This service is not available with the version of Windows you are upgrading to, and it will be disabled after you upgrade this computer. Therefore, if you are running applications that require ILS, you should maintain at least one server in your organization that can run ILS. For example, you should consider maintaining an ILS server in the following cases:

 o If you are running NetMeeting version 2.11 or earlier.
 o If you are running TAPI 3.0-based applications, such as Phone Dialer.

Windows XP and higher versions of Windows include TAPI version 3.1, which supports ILS as well as TAPI application directory partitions. If you plan to upgrade all servers in your organization to Windows Server 2003 or higher, and therefore lose the ability to run ILS, you must configure a TAPI application directory partition on a domain controller running Windows Server 2003 or higher to support your clients. For more information, see Knowledge Base article 280319, "Error Message When Upgrading Computer That Runs Internet Locator Service".
