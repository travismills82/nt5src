This computer is running the Microsoft® Windows Media™ Services version 4. An updated version of Windows Media Services is integrated with Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, and Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, and it will replace your existing services. Most of the version 4 settings will be migrated or preserved during the upgrade; however, certain version 4 configurations are no longer supported, and you might need to review the configuration of Windows Media Services after the upgrade to ensure uninterrupted functionality.

Specifically, the On-Line Presentation Broadcast service that provides integration with Microsoft PowerPoint® and the Windows Media Multicast File Transfer Services are not migrated. Therefore, if you are running applications that require the On-Line Presentation Broadcast service or Windows Media Multicast File Transfer services, you should maintain at least one server in your organization that can run version 4. 

For additional information pertaining to upgrading your existing version of Windows Media Services to the version contained within this version of Microsoft Windows, see KB article 305366 at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=3492.
