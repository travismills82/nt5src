The version of IAS in Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, cannot support more than 50 RADIUS clients (for example, Microsoft Routing and RAS server or Cisco Wireless Access Points can be configured as a RADIUS client). However, the version of IAS in Windows 2000 Server installed on this computer is configured to support more than 50 RADIUS clients. 

If you continue, the new version of IAS will be installed, but it will not start unless you delete some of the RADIUS clients. To continue supporting more than 50 RADIUS clients, install Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition.
