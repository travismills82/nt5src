This computer is running the Microsoft® Windows Media™ Services version 4. An updated version of Windows Media Services is integrated with Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2003, Standard Edition, Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2003, Enterprise Edition, and Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2003, Datacenter Edition, and it will replace your existing services. Most of the version 4 settings will be migrated or preserved during the upgrade; however, certain version 4 configurations are no longer supported, and you might need to review the configuration of Windows Media Services after the upgrade to ensure uninterrupted functionality.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, the On-Line Presentation Broadcast service that provides integration with Microsoft PowerPoint® and the Windows Media Multicast File Transfer Services are not migrated. Therefore, if you are running applications that require the On-Line Presentation Broadcast service or Windows Media Multicast File Transfer services, you should maintain at least one server in your organization that can run version 4. 
</p>

<p>
For additional information pertaining to upgrading your existing version of Windows Media Services to the version contained within this version of Microsoft Windows, see KB article 305366 <a href=http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=3492> http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=3492.</a>
