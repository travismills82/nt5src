Microsoft Windows Setup has detected Windows NT 4.0 basic volumes in your computer. These volumes might include volume sets, mirror sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with parity.

If you proceed with this installation, these volumes will not be accessible in this version of Windows. If necessary, you can use ftonline to access these volumes to backup the data after the installation. 
 
You can also choose to cancel Setup, back up the contents of each Windows NT 4.0 basic volume, and delete these volumes before restarting Setup. After completing Setup, you can reconfigure these volumes using dynamic disks and restore the contents. See Microsoft Windows Help for more details.

It is recommended that you back up the contents of each Windows NT 4.0 basic volume before proceeding with Windows Setup.
