The currently installed driver for the Hewlett-Packard Extended Keyboard is not compatible with this version of Microsoft Windows and will be disabled during the upgrade.

Windows will install a standard keyboard driver so your keyboard will work, but you will lose the functionality of the special buttons on this model.
