The existing Distributed File System Root is hosted on a FAT partition. This is not compatible with this version of Microsoft Windows. To continue with the upgrade please convert the partition to NTFS, or delete the DFS root and then run the setup again.

For more information on converting a partition to NTFS, please refer to the Help topic for the command line tool CONVERT.EXE by typing "HELP CONVERT" at the command prompt.

To access the latest support articles for DFS, please check the Microsoft Knowledge Base at http://support.microsoft.com/search. Web addresses can change, so you might be unable to connect to this Web site.

For a list of software supported by this version of Windows, see the Microsoft Windows Compatibility List at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=9946.
