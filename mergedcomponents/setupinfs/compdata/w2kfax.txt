This version of Windows Fax will be installed as part of this upgrade, since an existing operating system Fax component is currently installed on this computer.

If you do not plan to use Fax, then for best security practice it is recommended that you uninstall it after the upgrade. You can remove the Fax component using Add or Remove Programs, Add\Remove Windows Components in the Control Panel.
