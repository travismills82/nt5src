<P>Servers running this Windows product do not support Application Center 2000 SP1 and earlier versions.</P>

<P>To work around this issue, upgrade to Application Center 2000 SP2.</P>

<H2><A NAME="bizdesk_navigation_links_wixl"></A> Commerce Server 2000 SP1 BizDesk navigation links</H2>

<P>When using Commerce Server 2000 SP1 and earlier versions on this Windows product, all BizDesk navigation links result in Active Server Pages (ASP) errors. To work around this issue, you must modify the IIS security metabase. </P>
<P class="note">Note</P>
<P class="indent">IIS must be stopped before you can save the metabase.xml file. The following procedure has not been tested under the Direct Metabase Edit option in the Internet Information Services Properties dialog box. </P>

<P class="proclabel">To modify the IIS security metabase</p>
<OL>
	<LI>Using Notepad, open the metabase.xml file located at %systemsdrive%\windows\system32\inetsrv\metabase.xml. </li>
	<LI>For every virtual directory that requires parent paths to be enabled, add this security statement:
<PRE><CODE>AspEnableParentPaths=</CODE>&quot;<CODE>TRUE</CODE>&quot;<CODE> </CODE></PRE>

<P>This property is inherited, so it is not necessary to add it to any subdirectories of a virtual directory that has this flag set.

<P>For better security, this value is not recommended for the root directory, as this will turn on the security setting for every Web directory on your server.

<P>The following is an example of a virtual directory header in the metabase.xml file:

<PRE><CODE>&lt;IIsWebVirtualDir           Location = </CODE>&quot;<CODE>/LM/W3SVC/1/ROOT/blanksite</CODE>&quot;<CODE>

<H2><A NAME="cluster_service_account_csa_permissions_wkbx"></A> Cluster Service Account permissions</H2>

<P>In Windows Datacenter Server, Limited Edition, new Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) resource installations fail to come online when Cluster Service Account (CSA) does not have permission to create child objects on the computer object associated with the dependent Network Name resource.</P>

<P>To work around this issue, you must open the Users and Computers MMC snap-in and then open the computer object properties to view the security descriptor. Select the <B>Create all Child Objects</B> check box to grant the CSA permission to create child objects on the computer object created by the Network Name resource. After that, you can bring the MSMQ resource online.</P>

<H2><A NAME="majority_node_set_jshi"></A> Majority Node Set </H2>

<H3><A NAME="not_to_be_used_as_a_general_purpose_quorum_mechanism_cjcp"></A> Not to be used as a general-purpose quorum mechanism</H3>

<P>The Majority Node Set quorum feature available for server clusters in Windows Datacenter Server, Limited Edition is a new technology that has a number of applications. Note, however, that it works differently from a traditional server cluster using a standard quorum resource. </P>

<P>This technology is not designed for use as a general-purpose quorum mechanism in Windows&nbsp;Datacenter Server, Limited Edition. Microsoft is releasing this feature as a technology preview that is designed to enable vendors and non-Microsoft software providers to evaluate the feature and to incorporate it into other value-add products and services. Standard quorum resources (physical disk resources or non-Microsoft resources) are recommended for use in server clusters that are deployed in end-user production environments.</P>

<H3><A NAME="only_one_instance_can_exist_in_the_cluster_ucxs"></A> Only one instance can exist in the cluster</H3>

<P>In Windows&nbsp;Datacenter Server, Limited Edition, only one instance of the Majority Node Set resource can exist in the cluster.</P>

<P>To work around this issue, do not create two or more Majority Node Set resources on the same cluster.</P>

<H2><A NAME="message_queuing_msmq_fails_to_install_on_a_cluster1_oqiw"></A> Message Queuing fails to install on a cluster</H2>

<H2><A NAME="network_load_balancing_dndf"></A> Network Load Balancing</H2>

<H3><A NAME="access_denied_nnfn"></A> Access denied</H3>

<P>Network Load Balancing Manager fails to get authenticated on a host on which it needs to perform an operation, resulting in the following error message:</P>

<P><CODE>Win32: Access Denied</CODE></P>

<P>To work around this issue, enter new credentials in Network Load Balancing Manager. The host that denied access to Network Load Balancing Manager will authenticate the new credentials.</P>

<H3><A NAME="backwards_compatibility_dmcp"></A> Backward compatibility</H3>

<P>Network Load Balancing Manager is not backwards compatible with Windows&nbsp;2000 products. There is no workaround for this issue.</P>

<H3><A NAME="viewing_hosts_in_the_cluster_lqsw"></A> Connecting to existing clusters</H3>

<P>When you use the <B>Connect to Existing</B> option in Network Load Balancing Manager in Windows&nbsp;Datacenter Server, Limited Edition to connect to an existing cluster so that you can manage it, Network Load Balancing Manager does not automatically display all of the hosts in the cluster.</P>

<P class="proclabel">To see all of the hosts in the cluster</p>
<OL>
	<LI>Create a text file that lists the host names or their dedicated IP addresses, with each host name or IP address on a separate line.</li>
	<LI>Load this file into Network Load Balancing Manager by clicking <B>File</B> and then clicking <B>Load Host List</B>. 
<P>Network Load Balancing Manager will contact each of the hosts, get the network load balancing information, and then display this information in the Network Load Balancing Manager user interface. 
</li></OL>

<P>You can also load the text file by entering it as an argument when starting Network Load Balancing Manager from a command line, as in the following example: </P>

<PRE><CODE>nlbmgr.exe -hostlist &lt;host file name&gt;</CODE></PRE>

<H3><A NAME="encryption_of_user_credentials_hnhb"></A> Encryption of user credentials</H3>

<P>Network Load Balancing Manager user credentials are stored in unencrypted form in memory, which may pose a security risk to your system.</P>

<P>To work around this issue, do not enter credentials in Network Load Balancing Manager if you have security concerns. To use Network Load Balancing Manager without setting the credentials, ensure that the logon credentials you use to log on to the machine on which Network Load Balancing Manager is being run have system administrator privileges on all of the host servers in the cluster.</P>

<H3><A NAME="limited_error_checking_yufn"></A> Limited error checking</H3>

<P>The error-checking capabilities in Network Load Balancing Manager for Windows&nbsp;Datacenter Server, Limited Edition are very limited. </P>

<P>When creating a new cluster: 

<UL>
	<LI>Network Load Balancing Manager does not attempt to preempt an IP address conflict by finding out whether the new cluster IP address already exists somewhere on the network. </li></UL>

<P>When connecting to an existing cluster:

<UL>
	<LI>It does not check to see whether a preconfigured cluster that it is trying to connect to is not configured correctly or is in any state other than converged.</li>
	<LI>It does not check to see whether the dedicated IP address that a user specifies is already being used by some other computer on the network.</li></UL>

<P>To work around this issue, refer to the troubleshooting guide in online Help to determine the problem with your cluster. After you identify the problem, you can use Network Load Balancing Manager to change cluster parameters remotely to address the problem.</P>

<H3><A NAME="manager_logs_nttc"></A> Manager logs</H3>

<P>The Network Load Balancing Manager logs displayed in the lower half of the Network Load Balancing Manager windows are not saved to a log file by default.</P>

<P>To work around this issue, save the Network Load Balancing Manager logs to a specific log file using the <B>Log</B> option on the <B>Options</B> menu. All subsequent events will be logged to this log file, and the file will be saved when the user quits Network Load Balancing Manager.</P>

<H3><A NAME="mode_changes_fxwg"></A> Mode changes</H3>

<P>Mode changes&#0151;from unicast to multicast or vice versa&#0151;that you make through Network Load Balancing Manager are not supported in Windows&nbsp;Datacenter Server, Limited Edition and might result in unexpected behavior.</P>

<P>To work around this issue, change modes only at the host server, one host at a time. For additional information, see Help and Support Center (click <B>Start</B> and then click <B>Help and Support</B>).</P>

<H3><A NAME="multiple_web_sites_or_applications_maoz"></A> Multiple Web sites or applications</H3>

<P>If you create a network load balancing cluster, Network Load Balancing Manager will automatically add the cluster IP address to TCP/IP for each host server in the cluster. However, when you are load-balancing multiple Web sites or applications on this same network load-balancing cluster, Network Load Balancing Manager in Windows&nbsp;Datacenter Server, Limited Edition will not have support to add these additional IP addresses to the cluster hosts. You must do this manually.</P>

<P>To work around this issue, you must manually enter the IP addresses corresponding to the additional Web sites or applications in the TCP/IP properties of each host server in the cluster. You can use Network Load Balancing Manager to configure the Per-IP port rules for these IP addresses. </P>

<H3><A NAME="remote_control_password_dlto"></A> Remote control password</H3>

<P>Changing remote control passwords by using Network Load Balancing Manager is not supported in Windows&nbsp;Datacenter Server, Limited Edition.</P>

<P>To work around this issue, you must change the password by using the Network Load Balancing user interface on each host server.</P>

<H3><A NAME="verification_of_user_credentials_reyf"></A> Verification of user credentials</H3>

<P>Network Load Balancing Manager requires the user to enter his or her credentials, which are then verified with the local host server on which an operation is being performed by Network Load Balancing Manager. Those credentials are not saved when the user quits Network Load Balancing Manager.</P>

<P>There is no workaround for this issue. You must reenter user credentials each time you use Network Load Balancing Manager.</P>

<H3><A NAME="using_phones_in_rtc_deployments_wbxq"></A> Using phones in Real-Time Communications deployments</H3>

<P>To use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phones in your deployment, you need to add a new domain entry to the Registrar domain table. To do this, open the Real-Time Communications (RTC) service Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, right-click the Registrar Module icon in the Routing Extension module, and then add a new domain with the name &quot;<CODE>*;user=phone</CODE>&quot;.</P>

<P>To use Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) phones by routing calls through the IP to the PSTN gateway, create an entry in the routing table. To do this, open the RTC server MMC snap-in. In the routing pane, add two routes, as described in the following procedures.</P>

<P class="proclabel">To add the first route</p>
<OL>
	<LI>Type <B>User *</B>.</li>
	<LI>Type <B>domain name &lt;Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the SIP proxy server&gt;</B>.</li>

<P>Security has been upgraded for Windows&nbsp;Datacenter Server, Limited Edition. </P>

<P>Applications that try to open a Local Security Authority (LSA) handle anonymously will not be permitted access. This might result in some applications failing and returning an &quot;Access Denied&quot; error message.</P>

<P>For example, if you have a Structured Query Language (SQL) database hosted on a computer running Windows&nbsp;Datacenter Server, Limited Edition, with an Internet Information Services (IIS) server using Named Pipes accessing the SQL database, the following error might be reported:</P>

<P>0x80004005 on an Access Data Object (ADODB) Open. </P>

<P>To verify that the failure is caused by the application trying to make an anonymous call, check the computer's event log for Event ID=6033. This log tells you how to disable this security feature if it does block functionality. </P>

This is because a Windows&nbsp;Datacenter Server, Limited Edition certification authority expects only signed Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) responses from domain controllers. This only applies to any new version 2 template that is created or duplicated.</P>

<P>To work around this issue, apply the QFE provided in Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q308385 on all domain controllers.</P>
