                     Installing on Cluster Nodes

**********************************************************************


This part of the text file series provides information about
installing on cluster nodes. With Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, you can use clustering to ensure that users have
constant access to important server-based resources. With clustering,
you create several cluster nodes that appear to users as one server.
If one of the nodes in the cluster fails, another node begins to
provide service (a process known as failover). Critical applications
and resources remain continuously available.

For more information about the deployment of servers, see the
Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can view the
Windows Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at:

-------------------------------------
1.1   Important Information to Review
-------------------------------------
To prepare for installing clustering:

   * Review Datactr1.TXT and Datactr2.TXT for general information
     about Setup.

   * As described in Datactr1.TXT, confirm that your hardware,
     including your cluster storage, is compatible with products in
     the Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware
     compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

   * In addition, check with the manufacturer of your cluster storage
     hardware to be sure you have the drivers you need to use the
     hardware with Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

        IMPORTANT: You must ensure that hardware in your entire
        cluster solution is compatible with products in the
        Windows Server 2003 family. For more information, see
        "Cluster hardware and drivers" in the "Planning for Cluster
        Installation" section later in this text file.

---------------------------------------
1.3   Planning for Cluster Installation
---------------------------------------
Before carrying out cluster installation, you need to plan hardware
and network details.

   CAUTION: If you are using a shared storage device, before creating
   a cluster, when you turn on the computer and start the operating
   system, it is very important that only one node has access to the
   cluster disk. Otherwise, the cluster disks can become corrupted.
   To prevent the corruption of the cluster disks, shut down all but
   one cluster node, or use other techniques (for example, LUN
   masking, selective presentation, or zoning) to protect the cluster
   disks, before creating the cluster. Once the Cluster service is
   running properly on one node, the other nodes can be installed and
   configured simultaneously. Each node of your cluster must be
   running Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

In your planning, review the following items:

Cluster hardware and drivers
----------------------------
Microsoft supports only complete server cluster systems that are
compatible with the Windows Server 2003 family. Confirm that your
entire cluster solution is compatible with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware
compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

For cluster disks, you must use the NTFS file system and configure
the disks as basic disks. You cannot configure cluster disks as
dynamic disks, and you cannot use features of dynamic disks such as
spanned volumes (volume sets).

Review the manufacturer's instructions carefully before you begin
installing cluster hardware. Otherwise the cluster storage could
be corrupted.

To simplify configuration and eliminate potential compatibility
problems, consider using identical hardware for all nodes.

Network adapters on the cluster nodes
-------------------------------------
In your planning, decide what kind of communication each network
adapter will carry. The following list provides details about the
types of communication that an adapter can carry:

   * Only node-to-node communication (private network). This implies
     that the server has one or more additional adapters to carry
     other communication.

     For node-to-node communication, you connect the network adapter
     to a private network that is used exclusively within the cluster.
     Note that if the private network uses a single hub or network
     switch, that piece of equipment becomes a potential point of
     failure in your cluster.

     The nodes of a cluster must be on the same subnet but you can use
     virtual LAN (VLAN) switches on the interconnects between two
     nodes. If you use a VLAN, the point-to-point, round-trip latency
     must be less than 1/2 second and the link between two nodes must
     appear as a single point-to-point connection from the perspective
     of the Windows operating system running on the nodes. To avoid
     single points of failure, use independent VLAN hardware for the
     different paths between the nodes.

     If your nodes use multiple private (node-to-node) networks, it is
     a best practice for the adapters for those networks to use static
     IP addresses instead of DHCP.

   * Only client-to-cluster communication (public network). This
     implies that the server has one or more additional adapters to
     carry other communication.

   * Both node-to-node and client-to-cluster communication (mixed
     network). When you have multiple network adapters per node, a
     network adapter that carries both kinds of communication can
     serve as a backup for other network adapters.

   * Communication unrelated to the cluster. If a clustered node also
     provides services unrelated to the cluster, and there are enough
     adapters in the cluster node, you might want to use one adapter
     for carrying communication unrelated to the cluster.

The nodes of a cluster must be connected by two or more local area
networks (LANs); at least two networks are required to prevent a
single point of failure. A server cluster whose nodes are connected by
only one network is not a supported configuration. The adapters,
cables, hubs, and switches for each network must fail independently.
This usually implies that the components of any two networks must be
physically independent.

At least two networks must be configured to handle "All
communications (mixed network)" or "Internal cluster communications
only (private network)."

The recommended configuration for two adapters is to use one adapter
for the private (node-to-node only) communication and the other
adapter for mixed communication (node-to-node plus client-to-cluster
communication). Do not use teaming network adapters on the
private network.

If you use fault tolerant network adapters, create multiple private
networks instead of a single fault-tolerant network.

Do not configure a default gateway or DNS or WINS server on the
private network adapters. Do not configure private network adapters to
use name resolution servers on the public network; otherwise a name
resolution server on the public network might map a name to an IP
address on the private network. If a client then received that IP
address from the name resolution server, it might fail to reach the
address because no route from the client to the private network
address exists.

Configure WINS and/or DNS servers on the public network adapters. If
Network Name resources are used on the public networks, set up the DNS
servers to support dynamic updates; otherwise the Network Name
resources may not fail over correctly. Also, configure a default
gateway on the public network adapters. If there are multiple public
networks in the cluster, configure a default gateway on only one
of these.

When you use either the New Server Cluster Wizard or the Add Nodes
Wizard to install clustering on a node that contains two network
adapters, by default the wizard configures both of the network
adapters for mixed network communications. As a best practice,
reconfigure one adapter for private network communications only. For
more information, see "Change how the cluster uses a network" in Help
and Support Center for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.
To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start,
and then click Help and Support. You can also view Help and Support
Center topics on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

Consider choosing a name for each connection that tells what it is
intended for. The name will make it easier to identify the connection
whenever you are configuring the server.

Manually configure the communication settings, such as Speed, Duplex
Mode, Flow Control and Media Type of each cluster network adapter. Do
not use automatic detection. You must configure all of the cluster
network adapters to use the same communication settings.

The adapters on a given node must connect to networks using different
subnet masks.

Do not use the same IP address for two network adapters, even if they
are connected to two different networks.

   Note: Confirm that your entire cluster solution is compatible with
   the products in the Windows Server 2003 family. For more
   information, see "Cluster hardware and drivers" earlier in this
   section. If you use a crossover cable to implement a private
   network, when the cluster is created on the first node the second
   node should be turned on but stopped in the BIOS or at the startup
   menu. In this state, the Media Sense feature of Windows might not
   recognize the network adapter as connected. If you continue
   creating the cluster, the crossover cable will be detected when
   you start the second node. The network will be established in the
   default mode, which is mixed. You can then change the network mode
   to private using Cluster Administrator.

Cluster IP address
------------------
Obtain a static IP address for the cluster itself. You cannot use
DHCP for this address.

IP addressing for cluster nodes
-------------------------------
Determine how to handle the IP addressing for the individual cluster
nodes. Each network adapter on each node requires IP addressing. It is
a best practice to assign each network adapter a static IP address. As
an alternative, you can provide IP addressing through DHCP. If you use
static IP addresses, set the addresses for each linked pair of network
adapters (linked node-to-node) to be on the same subnet.

Note that if you use DHCP for the individual cluster nodes, it can
act as a single point of failure. That is, if you set up your cluster
nodes so that they depend on a DHCP server for their IP addresses,
temporary failure of the DHCP server can mean temporary unavailability
of the cluster nodes. When deciding whether to use DHCP, evaluate ways
to ensure availability of DHCP services, and consider the possibility
of using long leases for the cluster nodes. This helps to ensure that
they always have a valid IP address.

Cluster name
------------
Determine or obtain an appropriate name for the cluster. This is the
name administrators will use for connections to the cluster. (The
actual applications running on the cluster typically have different
network names.) The cluster name must be different from the domain
name, from all computer names on the domain, and from other cluster
names on the domain.

Computer accounts and domain assignment for cluster nodes
---------------------------------------------------------
Make sure that the cluster nodes all have computer accounts in the
same domain. Cluster nodes cannot be in a workgroup.

Operator user account for installing and configuring the Cluster
service
----------------------------------------------------------------
To install and configure the cluster service, you must be using an
account that is in the local Administrators group on each node. As you
install and configure each node, if you are not using an account in
the local Administrators group, you will be prompted to provide the
logon credentials for such an account.

Cluster service user account
----------------------------
Create or obtain the Cluster service user account. This is the name
and password under which the Cluster service will run. You need to
supply this user name and password during cluster installation.

It is best if the Cluster service user account is an account not used
for any other purpose. If you have multiple clusters, set up a unique
Cluster service user account for each cluster. The account must be a
domain account; it cannot be a local account. However, do not make
this account a domain administrator account because it does not need
domain administrator user rights.

As part of the cluster setup process, the Cluster service user
account is added to the local Administrators group on each node. As
well as being a member of the local Administrators group, the Cluster
service user account requires an additional set of user rights:

   * Act as part of the operating system.
  
   * Back up files and directories.

   * Adjust memory quotas for a process.

   * Increase scheduling priority.

   * Log on as a service.

   * Restore files and directories.

These user rights are also granted to the Cluster service user
account as part of the cluster setup process. Be aware that the
Cluster service user account will continue to have these user rights
even after all nodes are evicted from the cluster. The risk that this
presents is mitigated by the fact that these user rights are not
granted domain wide, but rather only locally on each former node.
However, remove this account from each evicted node if it is no longer
needed.

Be sure to keep the password from expiring on the Cluster service
user account (follow your organization's policies for password
renewal).

Volume for important cluster configuration information (checkpoint and
log files)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan on setting aside a volume on your cluster storage for holding
important cluster configuration information. This information makes up
the cluster quorum resource, which is needed when a cluster node stops
functioning. The quorum resource provides node-independent storage of
crucial data needed by the cluster. For important information on
quorum resource options, see "Quorum Resource Options" later in this
text file.

The recommended minimum size for the volume is 500 MB. It is
recommended that you do not store user data on any volume in the
quorum resource.

   Note: When planning and carrying out disk configuration for the
   cluster disks, configure them as basic disks with all partitions
   formatted as NTFS (they can be either compressed or uncompressed).
   Partition and format all disks on the cluster storage device
   before adding the first node to your cluster. Do not configure
   them as dynamic disks, and do not use spanned volumes
   (volume sets), or Remote Storage on the cluster disks. For the
   64-bit version of Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition,
   cluster disks on the cluster storage device must be partitioned
   as MBR and not as GPT disks.


-----------------------------
1.4   Quorum Resource Options
-----------------------------
With server clusters on Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition,
you can now choose between three ways to set up the quorum resource
(the resource that maintains the definitive copy of the cluster
configuration data and that must always be available for the cluster
to run). The first is a single node server cluster, which has been
available in the past and continues to be supported. A single node
cluster is often used for development and testing and can be
configured with, or without, external cluster storage devices. For
single node clusters without an external cluster storage device, the
local disk is configured as the cluster quorum device.

The second option is a single quorum device server cluster, which has
also been available in earlier Windows versions. This model places the
cluster configuration data on a shared cluster storage device that all
nodes can access. This is the most common model and is recommended for
most situations. You might choose the single quorum device model if
all of your cluster nodes are in the same location and you want to
take advantage of the fact such a cluster continues supporting users
even if only one node is running.

The third option, which is new for Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, is a "majority node set." A majority node set is
a single quorum resource from a server cluster perspective; however,
the cluster configuration data is actually stored on multiple disks
across the cluster. The majority node set resource ensures that the
cluster configuration data is kept consistent across the different
disks. In the majority node set model, every node in the cluster uses
a directory on its own local system disk to store the cluster
configuration data. If the configuration of the cluster changes, that
change is reflected across the different disks. Be aware that it is
also possible to have shared storage devices in a majority node set
cluster. The exact configuration depends on the requirements for your
installation.

Only use a majority node set cluster in targeted scenarios, such as:

   * Geographically dispersed cluster: A cluster that spans
     multiple sites.

   * Eliminating single points of failure: Although when using a
     single cluster storage device the quorum disk itself can be made
     highly available via RAID, the controller port or the Host Bus
     Adapter (HBA) itself may be a single point of failure.

   * Clusters with no shared disks: There are some specialized
     configurations that need tightly consistent cluster features
     without having shared disks.

   * Clusters that host applications that can fail over, but where
     there is some other, application-specific way, to replicate or
     mirror data between nodes: For example, this model is useful if
     you use database log shipping for keeping a SQL database state up
     to date.

Do not configure your cluster as a majority node set cluster unless
it is part of a cluster solution offered by your Original Equipment
Manufacturer (OEM), Independent Software Vendor (ISV), or Independent
Hardware Vendor (IHV).


1.4.1  Cluster Model Considerations
-----------------------------------
Before implementing your cluster, consider what type of quorum
resource solution you plan to use. Take into consideration the
following differences between single quorum device clusters and
majority node set clusters.

   Note: The following information is presented to help you make
   basic decisions about the placement and management of your cluster
   nodes and quorum resource. It does not provide all the details
   about the requirements for each cluster model, or how each model
   handles failover situations. If you are not sure which model to
   use or where you want to place your cluster nodes, install
   Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, on the first cluster
   node, then consult the on-line help cluster documentation in Help
   and Support Center for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
   Edition. See "Using a Majority Node Set" later in this text file
   for more information on how to access Help and Support Center.


Node failover behavior
----------------------
The failover behavior of the majority node set is significantly
different from the behavior of the single quorum device model:

   * Using the single quorum device model, you can maintain cluster
     availability with only a single operational node.

   * If you use a majority node set, more than half, or (Number of
     nodes configured in the cluster/2) + 1 nodes must be operational
     to maintain cluster availability. The following table shows the
     number of node failures that a given majority node set cluster
     can tolerate yet continue to operate:

   ===================================================================
   NUMBER OF NODES       NUMBER OF NODE            NUMBER OF NODES
   CONFIGURED IN THE     FAILURES ALLOWED          NEEDED TO CONTINUE

   2                     0                         2
   3                     1                         2
   4                     1                         3
   5                     2                         3
   6                     2                         4
   7                     3                         4
   8                     3                         5


Geographic considerations
-------------------------
You would commonly use a single quorum resource model if all nodes in
your cluster will be in the same geographical location. As part of
this requirement, your nodes must be connected to the same physical
storage device.

A majority node set on the other hand would typically be appropriate
if you have geographically dispersed nodes. The cluster configuration
data is stored locally on each node on a file share that is shared out
to the other nodes on the network. However, those shares must always
be accessible or nodes can fail.

There are other specific requirements for geographically dispersed
clusters, including the requirement that round-trip latency of the
network between cluster nodes be a maximum of 500 milliseconds. For
information on cluster solutions that meet all requirements for a
geographically dispersed cluster, refer to hardware compatibility
information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

Hardware
--------
Microsoft supports only complete server cluster systems that are
compatible with the Windows Server 2003 family of products. For
both cluster models, confirm that your system or hardware components,
including your cluster disks, are compatible with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family by checking the hardware compatibility
information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


1.4.2  Using a Majority Node Set
--------------------------------
This section tells how to obtain additional information about the
majority node set model. For a description of a majority node set,
see "Quorum Resource Options" earlier in this text file.

   IMPORTANT: Before implementing a majority node set, it is highly
   recommended that you read the online clustering documentation in
   Help and Support Center to thoroughly understand all the
   considerations, requirements, and restrictions for each type of
   quorum resource solution.

======================================================================
2.0   Beginning the Cluster Installation on the First Cluster Node
======================================================================


The steps you carry out when first physically connecting and
installing the cluster hardware are crucial. Be sure to follow the
hardware manufacturer's instructions for these initial steps.

   IMPORTANT: Carefully review your network cables after connecting
   them. Make sure no cables are crossed by mistake (for example,
   private network connected to public).


2.1   Initial Steps to Carry Out in the BIOS or EFI When Using a
      Fibre Channel Shared Storage Device or No Shared Storage Device
---------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Turn on a single node. Leave all other nodes turned off.

   * During this initial installation phase, remain in the BIOS or
     Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) configuration process, and
     do not allow the operating system to start. While viewing the
     BIOS or EFI configuration screens, ensure that you can scan the
     bus and see the drives from the active cluster node. On a 32-bit
     computer, use the BIOS configuration screens. On an Itanium
     architecture-based computer, use the EFI configuration screens.
     Consult the instructions from your manufacturer to determine
     whether these configuration screens are displayed automatically
     or whether you must, after turning on the computer, press
     specific keys to access them. Follow the manufacturer's
     instructions for completing the BIOS or EFI
     configuration process.


2.2   Final Steps to Complete the Installation
----------------------------------------------
If you have not already installed Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, on the first cluster node, install it before
proceeding. For information about decisions you must make, such as
decisions about licensing, see Datactr1.TXT. For information about
running Setup, see Datactr2.TXT.

After you complete the BIOS or EFI configuration, start the operating
system on one cluster node only, and complete the configuration of the
Cluster service using Cluster Administrator.

With the Cluster Administrator New Server Cluster Wizard, you can
choose between Typical (full) configuration and Advanced (minimum)
configuration options. Typical configuration is appropriate for most
installations and results in a completely configured cluster. Use
the Advanced configuration option only for clusters that have complex
storage configurations that the New Server Cluster Wizard cannot
validate or for configurations in which you do not want the cluster
to manage all of the storage. The following examples describe
each situation:

   * In some complex storage solutions, such as a fiber channel
     switched fabric that contains several switches, a particular
     storage unit might have a different identity on each computer in
     the cluster. Although this is a valid storage configuration, it
     violates the storage validation heuristics in the New Server
     Cluster Wizard. If you have this type of storage solution, you
     might receive an error when you are trying to create a cluster
     using the Typical configuration option. If your storage
     configuration is set up correctly, you can disable the storage
     validation heuristics and avoid this error by restarting the New
     Server Cluster Wizard, selecting the Advanced configuration
     option instead.

   * On particular nodes in a cluster, you may want to have some disks
     that are to be clustered and some disks that are to be kept
     private. The Typical configuration option configures all disks as
     clustered disks and creates cluster resources for them all.
     However, with the Advanced configuration option, you can keep
     certain disks private because this configuration creates a
     cluster in which only the quorum disk is managed by the cluster
     (if you chose to use a physical disk as the quorum resource).
     After the cluster is created, you must then use Cluster
     Administrator to add any other disks that you want the cluster to
     manage.

If you are using a shared storage device: Before creating a cluster,
when you turn the computer on and start the operating system, it is
very important that only one node has access to the cluster disk.
Otherwise, the cluster disks can become corrupted. To prevent the
corruption of the cluster disks, shut down all but one cluster node,
or use other techniques (for example, LUN masking, selective
presentation, or zoning) to protect the cluster disks before creating
the cluster. Also, before starting the installation of the second and
subsequent nodes, ensure that all disks that are to be managed by the
cluster have disk resources associated with them. If these disks do
not have disk resources associated with them at this time, the disk
data will be corrupted because the disks will not be protected and
multiple nodes will attempt to connect to them at the same time.

>>>TO SET UP YOUR CLUSTER USING CLUSTER ADMINISTRATOR

   1. Open Cluster Administrator by clicking Start, pointing to
      Programs, pointing to Administrative Tools, and then clicking
      Cluster Administrator.

   2. In the Open Connection to Cluster dialog box that appears, in
      Action, select Create new cluster, then click OK.

   3. The New Server Cluster Wizard appears. Click Next to continue.

   4. Upon completion of the New Server Cluster Wizard, click Finish.

         IMPORTANT: During the cluster creation process (using the
         Quorum button on the Proposed Cluster Configuration page)
         you will be able to select a quorum resource type (that is,
         a Local Quorum resource, Physical Disk or other storage
         class device resource, or Majority Node Set resource). For
         information on how these quorum resource types relate to the
         different cluster models, see "Quorum Resource Options"
         earlier in this text file. Do not use Manage Your Server or
         the Configure Your Server Wizard to configure cluster nodes.

Unattended Installation
-----------------------
To create and configure a cluster after unattended Setup, run a
script to invoke the cluster /create: command and supply all the
necessary configuration information on the command line. For more
information on creating a cluster using unattended installation, after
you install Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, see "To
create a cluster" in Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support
Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and
Support. Also, see the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit,
especially "Automating and Customizing Installations."
