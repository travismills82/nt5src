1.0 Before You Begin
======================================================================

Before you install Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, read this
section to ensure that your equipment meets the minimum requirements
and that you have the information you will need during Setup.

-------------------------
1.1 Hardware Requirements
-------------------------
Before you install Windows XP, make sure your computer meets the
following minimum hardware requirements:

   * 733 megahertz (MHz) Intel Itanium architecture-based
     microprocessor

   * 512 megabytes (MB) of RAM (minimum)

   * 4 GB of free hard disk space (minimum) for Setup

   * VGA monitor or better

   * Keyboard

   * Mouse or compatible pointing device

   * CD-ROM drive

For network installation:

   * Windows XP-compatible network adapter card and related cable

   * Access to the network share that contains the Setup files

------------------------------------------------
1.2 Checking Hardware and Software Compatibility
------------------------------------------------
Setup automatically checks your hardware and software and reports
any potential conflicts. To help ensure a successful installation,
however, you should determine whether your computer hardware is
compatible with Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 before you
start Setup. This is particularly important if you are using a
high-end video card for rendering three-dimensional graphics, or if
you are using computer peripherals other than the minimum hardware 
requirements mentioned in the previous section.

You can view compatibility information at the Microsoft
Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog

   IMPORTANT: Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 supports only
   those devices listed in the Windows Catalog. If your hardware is
   not on this list, contact the hardware manufacturer and ask for 
   a Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 driver for the component. 

During Setup, you can use Dynamic Update to ensure that you are 
getting the most up-to-date Setup files for Windows XP 64-Bit Edition
Version 2003.

---------------------------------
1.3 Obtaining Network Information
---------------------------------
The first step is to decide whether your computer is joining a domain
or a workgroup. If you do not know which option to choose or if your
computer will not be connected to a network, select the workgroup
option. (You can join a domain after you install Windows XP.)

If your computer is currently connected to a network, request the
following information from your network administrator before you
begin the setup process:

   * Name of your computer

   * Name of the workgroup or domain

   * TCP/IP address (if your network does not have a Dynamic Host
     Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server)

To connect to a network during Setup, you must have the correct
hardware installed on your computer and it must be connected by 
a network cable. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
1.4 Disk Partitioning Requirements for Itanium Architecture-based
    Computers
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Itanium architecture-based computers have specific partitioning
requirements.
Two partitions are created automatically when you install Windows XP
64-Bit Edition Version 2003 for the first time on your computer.

   *  The first partition is a FAT partition of about 100 megabytes
      (MB). Called the EFI system Partition, this partition is used
      to store programs and information files that the Extensible
      Firmware Interface (EFI) uses to automatically start
      Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003.

   *  The Microsoft Reserved (MSR) partition may be 32 MB or 128 MB, 
      depending on the size of the hard disk. The MSR partition
      allows the operating system to perform operations that require
      dedicated disk space, such as changing a disk from basic to
      dynamic. (Note, on hard disks larger than 16 GB, the MSR will
      be 128 MB.)

The EFI system partition is the first partition on your hard disk 
and the MSR partition is the second partition. If you are using 
multiple hard disks, the MSR partition is the first partition  on your
second hard disk and all subsequent hard disks. Only one  EFI system
partition is necessary for a computer, and it must be on your boot drive.

For information about EFI utilities, see the documentation supplied
by your computer vendor.

   IMPORTANT: The recommended minimum partition size for 
   installing Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 is 4 GB.

======================================================================
2.0 Installing Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003
======================================================================

Setup for Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 is divided into two
phases. The first phase is text-mode Setup. During this phase, Setup
copies files to the computer, checks your hardware, and configures
your installation. You can also choose to create multiple partitions
during this phase. Your computer will restart at the end of this
phase.

The second phase is GUI-mode Setup. During this phase, Setup gathers 
information such as regional options, user name and password, and 
network information. Your computer will restart when Setup is 
complete. 

Setup creates the EFI system partition and the MSR partition 
automatically. It is recommended that you create a single data 
partition of no less than 4 GB for installing the operating system. 

>>>To install Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003:

1. Ensure that the hardware for your Itanium architecture-based
   computer is set up properly and that everything is attached as it
   should be.

2. Turn on your computer.

3. Insert the Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 CD into the
   CD-ROM drive.

4. When prompted in the EFI Boot Manager, boot to the CD-ROM drive.

   When you see "Press any key to boot from CD-ROM...", press a key
   and text-mode Setup begins.

   If the CD does not start automatically, boot to the EFI shell, 
   select the CD-ROM drive, type:

   setupldr

   and then press ENTER.

      Note: Setup can create the EFI system partition and the MSR 
      partition automatically. If you want, you can choose to create 
      the EFI system partition yourself, but it is recommended that 
      you let Setup create this partition.

5. When prompted to install Windows, determine the size of 
   your data partition. The recommended minimum size for 
   installing Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 is 4 GB. 

6. Follow the directions that appear. Once GUI-mode Setup is 
   complete, the computer restarts automatically. 

--------------------------------------------
2.1 Collecting User and Computer Information
--------------------------------------------
Setup helps you gather information about you and your computer.
Although much of this installation process is automatic, you
might need to provide information or select settings on the
following pages, depending on the configuration of your computer:

   * Licensing Agreement. If you agree with the terms and want to
     continue the setup process, select the option labeled "I
     accept this agreement."

   * Select Special Options. Customize the Windows XP installation,
     language, and accessibility settings for new installations.
     You can set up Windows XP to use multiple languages and
     regional options.

   * Regional and Language Options. Change the system and user
     locale settings for different regions and languages.

   * Personalize Your Software. Type the full name of the person
     to whom this copy of Windows XP is licensed and, optionally,
     the organization.

   * Computer Name and Administrative Password. Type a unique computer
     name that differs from other computer, workgroup, or domain names
     on your network. Setup suggests a computer name, but you can
     change the name.

     Setup automatically creates an Administrator account during 
     installation. When you use this account, you have full rights
     over the computer's settings and can create user accounts on
     the computer. Logging on as an Administrator after you install 
     Windows XP gives you administrative rights that you need in 
     order to log on and manage your computer. Specify a password
     for the Administrator account. For security reasons, you should 
     always assign a password to the Administrator account. Take care
     to remember and protect your password.

   * Date and Time Settings. Verify the date and time for your region,
     select the appropriate time zone, and then select whether you
     want Windows XP to automatically adjust for daylight saving time.

   * Networking Settings. Unless you are an advanced user, select
     Typical settings for your network configuration. To manually 
     configure network clients, services, and protocols, select 
     Custom settings.

   * Workgroup or Computer Domain. During the setup process, you must
     join either a workgroup or a domain. For details on both of these
     options, see "Providing Networking Information" in section 2.2
     of this document.
     
   * Network Identification Wizard. If your computer is connected to a
     network, this wizard prompts you to identify the users who will
     be using your computer. Each person with an account on the
     computer can be assigned different levels of access.

------------------------------------
2.2 Providing Networking Information
------------------------------------
During or after the setup process, you need to join either a workgroup
or a domain. If you will not be working on a network, select the option
to join a workgroup.

2.2.1 Joining a Workgroup
-------------------------
A workgroup is one or more computers with the same workgroup name (for
example, a peer-to-peer network). Any user can join a workgroup by
typing the workgroup name--you don't need special permissions
to join a workgroup. You must provide an existing or new workgroup
name, or you can use the workgroup name that Setup suggests.

2.2.2 Joining a Domain
----------------------
A computer account identifies your computer to the domain, while the
user account identifies you to your computer.

A domain is a collection of computers defined by a network administrator.
Unlike joining a workgroup, which you can do yourself, joining a domain
requires permission from the network administrator.

To join a domain during the setup process, you must already have an
existing computer account in the domain you want to join, or have the
rights to create one. You are prompted to type a new computer account
name. Before you run Setup, ask your network administrator to create a
computer account. Or, if you have the appropriate rights, you can create
the account during the setup process and join the domain. To join a
domain, you need to provide your user name and password.

      Note: If you have difficulty joining a domain during the setup
      process, join a workgroup instead, and then join the domain 
      after you finish installing Windows XP.

---------------------------
2.3 Creating a User Account
---------------------------
Your user account identifies your user name and password, the groups
you are a member of, which network resources you have access to, and
your personal files and settings. Each person who regularly uses the
computer should have a user account. The user account is identified by
a user name and a password, both of which the user types when logging
on to the computer. You can create individual user accounts after
logging on to the computer by using an account with Administrator 
rights.

>>>To create a user account: 

1. Log on to the computer as a user with Administrator rights.

2. Click Start, click Control Panel, and then click User Accounts. 

3. If your computer is on a domain, click Add and then follow the 
   instructions that appear.

   If your computer is not on a domain, under Pick a task, click 
   Create a new account, and then follow the instructions that 
   appear on your screen.

3.0 Advanced Setup Options 
======================================================================

This section provides more detailed information and can help you make 
decisions about how you install Windows XP.

----------------
3.1 File Systems
----------------
Before you install Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, you should
decide which file system you will use. A file system is the method by
which information is stored on a hard disk.

Windows XP supports the NTFS file system or one of the file allocation
table file systems (FAT or FAT32). To set up a dual-boot configuration,
you should select one file system for all your partitions: FAT32 or NTFS.

   Note: The 102 MB EFI system partition will automatically use the
   FAT file system. You should not change this, because using 
   another file system will cause problems.

3.1.1 NTFS
----------
The NTFS file system is the recommended file system for use with
Windows XP. It has all of the basic capabilities of FAT, and it
provides the following advantages over the FAT and FAT32 file
systems:

   * Better file security
   * Better disk compression
   * Support for large hard disks, up to 2 terabytes (TB). (The
     maximum disk size for NTFS is much greater than for disks
     formatted as FAT, and as disk size increases, performance 
     with NTFS doesn't degrade as it does with FAT.)

3.1.2 FAT and FAT32
-------------------
FAT32 is an enhanced version of the FAT file system that can be used
on drives ranging from 512 MB to 32 GB. FAT and FAT32 offer compatibility
with operating systems other than Windows XP. 

-------------------
3.2 Disk Partitions
-------------------
Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your hard disk so that each
section functions as a separate unit. You can create a partition to
provide a place to back up data or to dual-boot with another operating
system. When you create partitions on a disk, you divide the disk into
one or more areas that can be formatted for use by a file system, such
as FAT32 or NTFS.

During text-mode Setup, you can create and delete partitions. Follow 
these guidelines for partitioning:

   *   A minimum of 4 GB is recommended for installing Windows XP 
       64-Bit Edition Version 2003. A partition of this size provides
       flexibility for adding future updates, operating system tools,
       or other files.

   *   During Setup, you should create and size only the partition on 
       which you want to install Windows XP. After Windows XP is 
       installed, you can use Disk Management to further partition the
       unallocated space.

For more information about Disk Management, open Help and Support 
Center from the Start menu in Windows.

----------------------------------
3.3 Modifying the EFI Boot Manager
----------------------------------
The EFI Boot Manager enables you to boot to the shell, to Windows XP 
or another operating system, or to the CD-ROM drive. Your computer 
will attempt to boot to each of the listed options, starting with the 
first option, until it finds a valid bootable entry. You can change 
the order of items on the boot menu. For example, if you want to boot 
to the shell first, you can make Shell the first item on your boot 
menu. If you install more than one operating system, you can choose 
which is listed first.

You can also make other changes to the Boot Manager menu, such as renaming
a boot option or exporting the boot options to a floppy disk.

>>>To make changes to your boot options:

1.  Boot to the EFI shell.

2.  Switch to the hard disk. Your hard disk is normally located at 
    fs0 or fs1. For example, type:

    fs0: 

    and then press ENTER.

3.  Change to the Msutil folder. Type:

    cd msutil

    and then press ENTER.
    If there is no Msutil folder, you are not in the correct place.
       
    Try a different fs option.

4.  Use the nvrboot.efi program to modify EFI Boot Manager options.
    To start it, type:

    nvrboot

    and then press ENTER.

5.  Make the changes to your boot options. For example, to rename 
    a boot option, type M to Modify, and then follow the directions
    that appear on your screen. To move a boot option to the top
    of the boot option menu, use the Push command. To save a copy
    of your boot options to a floppy disk, use the Export command.
