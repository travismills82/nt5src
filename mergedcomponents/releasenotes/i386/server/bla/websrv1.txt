======================================================================
1.0 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY
======================================================================
Before installing your server, make sure that you have chosen
hardware that supports Windows Server 2003, Web Edition.

-------------------------
1.1   System Requirements
-------------------------
To ensure adequate performance, make sure that computers on which you
install Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, meet the
following requirements:

   * One or two processors with a recommended minimum speed of 550 MHz
     (minimum supported speed is 133 MHz). A maximum of two processors
     per computer is supported. Processors from the Intel
     Pentium/Celeron family, AMD K6/Athlon/Duron family, or compatible
     processors are recommended.

   * 256 megabytes (MB) of RAM recommended minimum (128 MB
     minimum supported; 2 gigabytes (GB) maximum).

   * A hard disk partition or volume with enough free space to
     accommodate the setup process. To ensure that you have
     flexibility in your later use of the operating system, it is
     recommended that you allow considerably more space than the
     minimum required for running Setup, which is approximately 1.25
     GB to 2 GB. The larger amount of space is required if you are
     running Setup across a network instead of from a CD-ROM.

   You must use NTFS as the file system with Windows Server 2003,
   Web Edition.

      Note: The setup process requires the free disk space described
      in the previous paragraph. After Setup is finished, actual hard
      disk space used for the operating system will be more than the
      free space required for Setup, because of space needed for the
      paging file and for any optional components you install. The
      usual size for the paging file is 1.5 times the size of the RAM.
      For information about the paging file and about optional
      components, see Help and Support Center. To open Help and
      Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
      click Help and Support.

   * VGA or higher-resolution monitor (Super VGA 800x600 or higher
     recommended), keyboard, and (optionally) a mouse or other
     pointing device.

     As an alternative, for operation without a monitor or keyboard,
     you can choose a remote diagnostic and support processor that is
     designed for products in the Windows Server 2003 family. For
     details, see the hardware compatibility information in the
     Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

For CD-ROM installation:

   * A CD-ROM or DVD drive.

For network installation:

   * One or more network adapters and related cables that are designed
     for products in the Windows Server 2003 family. For details,
     see the hardware compatibility information in the Windows Catalog
     at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

   * A server from which to offer network access for the Setup files.

For additional hardware-based functionality:

   * Appropriate hardware for the functionality you require. For
     example, if you require sound, you must have a compatible sound
     card with speakers or headphones, and if you plan to support
     network clients, the servers and clients must have appropriate
     network adapters and cables. For details about your hardware, see
     the hardware compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:
  
        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

----------------------------
1.2   Hardware Compatibility
----------------------------
One of the most important steps to take before installing a server is
to confirm that your hardware is compatible with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family. You can do this by running a 
preinstallation compatibility check from the Setup CD or by checking
the hardware compatibility information at the Windows Catalog Web
site. Also, as part of confirming hardware compatibility, check to see
that you have obtained updated hardware device drivers and an updated
system BIOS.

Regardless of whether you run a preinstallation compatibility check,
Setup checks hardware and software compatibility at the beginning of
an installation and displays a report if there are incompatibilities.

Running a preinstallation compatibility check from the Setup CD
---------------------------------------------------------------
You can run a hardware and software compatibility check from the
Setup CD. The compatibility check does not require you to actually
begin an installation. To run the check, insert the Setup CD in
the CD-ROM drive and, when a display appears, follow the prompts for
checking system compatibility. You will be offered the option to
download the latest Setup files (through Dynamic Update) when you run
the check. If you have Internet connectivity, it is recommended that
you allow the download.

For more information about downloading the latest Setup files, see
"Using Dynamic Update for Updated Drivers and Other Setup Files" later
in this text file.

Another way to run the compatibility check is to insert the Setup CD
in the CD-ROM drive, open a command prompt, and type:

d:\i386\winnt32 /checkupgradeonly

where d represents the CD-ROM drive.

Checking hardware and software compatibility information on the
Microsoft Web site
---------------------------------------------------------------
Another way to confirm that your hardware and software are designed
for products in the Windows Server 2003 family is to check the
hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows Catalog
at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

Checking drivers and system BIOS
--------------------------------
Check that you have obtained updated drivers for your hardware
devices and that you have the latest system BIOS. The device
manufacturers can help you obtain these items.

1.2.1  Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) for your hard disk, confirm that the controller is
designed for products in the Windows Server 2003 family by
checking the hardware and software compatibility information in the
Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

If your controller is compatible, but you are aware that the
manufacturer has supplied a separate driver file for use with products
in the Windows Server 2003 family, obtain the file (on a floppy
disk) before you begin Setup. During the early part of Setup, a line
at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to press F6. Further
prompts will guide you in supplying the driver file to Setup so that
it can gain access to the mass storage controller.

If you are not sure whether you must obtain a separate driver file
from the manufacturer of your mass storage controller, you can try
running Setup. If the controller is not supported by the driver files
on the Setup CD, and therefore requires a driver file that is supplied
by the hardware manufacturer, Setup stops and displays a message
saying that no disk devices can be found, or it displays an incomplete
list of controllers. After you obtain the necessary driver file,
restart Setup, and press F6 when you are prompted.

1.2.2  Using a Custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) File
----------------------------------------------------
If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied
by your computer manufacturer, before you begin Setup, locate the
floppy disk or other medium containing the file. During the early part
of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen will prompt you to press
F6: at this time press F5 (not F6). After you press F5, follow the
prompts to include your HAL file in the Setup process.

1.2.3  Using Dynamic Update for Updated Drivers and Other Setup Files
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a working Internet connection on the computer on which
you run Setup, you can choose Dynamic Update during Setup and obtain
the most up-to-date Setup files, including drivers and other files.
Whenever an important update is made to any crucial Setup file, that
update is made available through Dynamic Update functionality built
into the Windows Update Web site. Some of the updated files will be
replacements (for example, an updated driver or updated Setup file)
and some will be additions (for example, a driver not available at the
time that the Setup CD was created). It is recommended that you use
Dynamic Update when running Setup.

Dynamic Update has been carefully designed so that it is reliable and
easy to use:

   * The files on the Dynamic Update section of the Windows Update Web
     site have been carefully tested and selected. Only files that are
     important in ensuring that Setup runs well are made available
     through Dynamic Update. Files with minor updates that will not
     significantly affect Setup are not part of Dynamic Update.

   * Because Dynamic Update downloads only the files that are required
     for your computer, the Dynamic Update software briefly examines
     your computer hardware. No personal information is collected, and
     no information is saved. The only purpose is to select
     appropriate drivers for your hardware configuration. This keeps
     the download as short as possible and ensures that only necessary
     drivers are downloaded to your hard disk.

   * You can use Dynamic Update when running a preinstallation
     compatibility check from the Setup CD, or when running Setup
     itself. Either way, you obtain the most up-to-date files for
     running Setup. For information about running the compatibility
     check, see "Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this text file.

   * You can use Dynamic Update with unattended Setup. Preparing for
     this requires several steps. For a brief description of
     unattended Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" in
     WebSrv2.TXT. For details about how to use Dynamic Update with
     unattended Setup (also called automated installation), see
     "Automating and Customizing Installations" in the Windows
     Server 2003 Deployment Kit.

The Windows Update Web site offers a variety of updates that you can
use after completing Setup. To learn more, go to:

   http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/

======================================================================
2.0 IMPORTANT FILES TO REVIEW
======================================================================
At some point in your planning process, before you run Setup,
familiarize yourself with the Relnotes.htm file found in the \Docs
folder on the Setup CD.

This file contains important usage information about hardware,
networking, applications, and printing. Also familiarize yourself with
information about hardware compatibility for products in
the Windows Server 2003 family. For more information, see
"Hardware Compatibility" earlier in this text file.

For the most recent information on compatible applications for
products in the Windows Server 2003 family, see the software
compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

======================================================================
3.0 DECISIONS TO MAKE FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
======================================================================
This list outlines the basic decisions to make for a
new installation.

What partition or volume you plan to install the operating system on
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are performing a new installation, review your disk partitions
or volumes before you run Setup. Both partitions and volumes divide a
disk into one or more areas that can be formatted for use by one file
system. Different partitions and volumes often have different drive
letters (for example, C: and D:). After you run Setup, you can make
adjustments to the disk configuration, as long as you do not reformat
or change the partition or volume that contains the operating system.
For information about planning the partitions or volumes for a new
installation, see "Planning Disk Partitions or Volumes for New
Installations" later in this text file.

How to handle IP addresses and TCP/IP name resolution
-----------------------------------------------------
With TCP/IP (the protocol used on the Internet), you need to make
decisions about how to handle IP addressing and name resolution (the
translating of IP addresses into names that users recognize). For more
information, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution"
later in this text file.

Whether to create domains or workgroups for your servers
--------------------------------------------------------
A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies, and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an
administrator to control access to resources and keep track of users.
For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains"
later in this text file.

======================================================================
4.0 PLANNING DISK PARTITIONS OR VOLUMES FOR NEW INSTALLATIONS
======================================================================
Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that
each section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions
on a basic disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can
be formatted for use by a file system, such as FAT or NTFS (with
Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, use only NTFS). Different
partitions often have different drive letters (for example, C: and
D:). A basic disk can have up to four primary partitions, or three
primary partitions and one extended partition. (An extended partition
can be subdivided into logical drives, while a primary partition
cannot be subdivided.)

   IMPORTANT: If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard
   disk, be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand, because
   these actions will destroy any existing data. As with any major
   change to disk contents, it is recommended that you back up the
   entire contents of the hard disk before working with partitions,
   even if you plan to leave one or more of your partitions alone.

   Note: If you plan to install to a dynamic disk (a disk type that
   can be created only with Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows XP, or a
   product in
   the Windows Server 2003 family), you cannot change the volume
   or partition sizes on the disk during Setup, and therefore no
   planning is needed regarding partition sizes. Instead, review the
   guidelines in "Working with Dynamic Disks and Setup" later in this
   text file.

Before you run Setup to perform a new installation, determine the
size of the partition on which to install. There is no set formula for
figuring a partition size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of
room for the operating system, applications, and other files that you
plan to put on the installation partition. The files for setting up
Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, require approximately 1.25 GB
to 2 GB, as described in "System Requirements" earlier in this text
file. It is recommended that you allow considerably more disk space
than the minimum amount. It is not unreasonable to allow 4 GB to 10 GB
on the partition, or more for large installations. This allows space
for a variety of items, including optional components, logs, future
service packs, the paging file used by the operating system, and other
items.

When you perform a new installation, you can specify the partition on
which to install. If you specify a partition on which another
operating system exists, you will be prompted to confirm your choice.

During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to
install Windows Server 2003, Web Edition. After installation is
complete, you can use Disk Management to manage new and existing disks
and volumes. This includes creating new partitions from unpartitioned
space; deleting, renaming, and reformatting existing partitions;
adding and removing hard disks; and changing a basic disk to the
dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic to basic.

-------------------------------------------------------------
4.1   File System Requirements for the Installation Partition
-------------------------------------------------------------
On Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, you must use NTFS as the
file system. NTFS includes a variety of features not included in the
FAT or FAT32 file systems, including better scalability to large
drives, better security, greater flexibility in compressing and
uncompressing, and many other features. If you want to install Windows
Server 2003, Web Edition, on a computer that has one or more FAT
or FAT32 partitions, delete the FAT or FAT32 partitions during Setup.
Then, if necessary, create the partition on which you will install
Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, and choose NTFS as the file
system for that partition. For information about deleting or creating
partitions during Setup, see the next section, "Options When
Partitioning a Disk."

For information about the modifications you can make to the disk
after Setup, see the previous section, "Planning Disk Partitions or
Volumes for New Installations."

--------------------------------------
4.2   Options When Partitioning a Disk
--------------------------------------
You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup only if you
are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. You can modify the
partitioning of the disk after Setup by using Disk Management.

If you are performing a new installation, Setup examines the hard
disk to determine its existing configuration, and then offers the
following options:

   * If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the
     partition on which you will install a product in the Windows
     Server 2003 family.

   * If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned disk
     space, you can create the partition for a Windows Server 2003
     family product by using the unpartitioned space.

   * If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough,
     you can install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family
     on that partition, with or without reformatting the partition
     first. Reformatting a partition erases all data on the partition.
     If you do not reformat the partition, but you do install a
     product in the Windows Server 2003 family where there is
     already an operating system, that operating system will be
     overwritten, and you must reinstall any applications you want to
     use with the Windows Server 2003 family product.

   * If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to
     create more unpartitioned disk space for a partition for a
     product in the Windows Server 2003 family. Deleting an
     existing partition also erases any data on that partition.

------------------------------------------
4.3   Working with Dynamic Disks and Setup
------------------------------------------
A dynamic disk is a disk using the new storage type introduced with
Microsoft Windows 2000. If you changed a disk to dynamic and you want
to perform a new installation on the disk, review the following.

   * If you used Windows 2000 or Windows XP to change a disk with no
     partitions directly to a dynamic disk, you must revert the disk
     to basic before you can install an operating system on it.

        CAUTION: All data will be lost in the process of reverting the
        disk to basic, so back it up first.

You can use Windows 2000 or Windows XP to revert the disk, or you can
use the Setup program for a product in the Windows Server 2003
family. To use Windows 2000 or Windows XP, follow the instructions in
Help for your operating system. To use Setup for a product in the
Windows Server 2003 family, during the partitioning phase, find
the dynamic disk among the list of available partitions and then
delete it (which erases all data on all volumes). You will be prompted
to confirm your action. After you do this, the disk will contain only
unpartitioned space, and you can use Setup to create a new (basic
disk) partition on it.

   * If you plan to rerun Setup on a computer on which a product in
     the Windows Server 2003 family was already installed, and the
     computer contains dynamic disks, be sure to read about the
     limitations for installing operating systems on disks that are
     changed to dynamic using a product in the Windows Server
     2003 family. For more information, see topics about dynamic disks
     and the partition table in Help and Support Center. To open Help
     and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
     click Help and Support.

======================================================================
5.0 NETWORKS: TCP/IP, IP ADDRESSES, AND NAME RESOLUTION
======================================================================
TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access.

To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP
address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through
software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these
addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also
have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this
type of name to an IP address is called name resolution, and can be
accomplished by various methods, primarily the Domain Name System
(DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The following sections
provide more information.

For detailed information about TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS, and WINS, see Help
and Support Center as well as the Windows Server 2003 Resource
Kit. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click
Start, and then click Help and Support.

You can also view Help and Support Center topics on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

------------------
5.1   IP Addresses
------------------
As outlined in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an
IP address be provided for each computer. This section describes IP
addressing options.

There are two basic approaches for providing an IP address for a
server you are installing:

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
------------------------------------------
You can provide IP addresses to the computers on your network by
configuring one or more DHCP servers, which provide IP addresses
dynamically to other computers. A DHCP server must itself be assigned
a static IP address.

One server or several servers can provide DHCP along with one or more
name resolution services, which are called Domain Name System (DNS)
and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The name resolution services
are described in the next section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP."

If you want to run Setup before you have finalized your decisions
about which server to use as your DHCP server and what static IP
address to assign to that server, you can choose "Typical settings" in
the Networking Settings dialog box during Setup and complete the
network configuration later. If you do this and there is no DHCP
server in the network, Setup will use a limited IP addressing option
called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). During the time that a
server is using APIPA, it can communicate only with other computers
using APIPA on the same network segment. A server that is using APIPA
cannot make connections to the Internet (for browsing or e-mail), and
cannot be used with DNS or Active Directory (which depends on DNS).

If you know which server you want to use as your DHCP server, when
installing that server, in the Networking Settings dialog box in
Setup, choose "Custom settings," and specify a static IP address and
related network settings. For more information about how to do this,
see "Specifying Networking Settings" in WebSrv2.TXT. After Setup, use
information in Help and Support Center (click Start and then click
Help and Support) to learn how to complete the configuration of DHCP
in your network.

Static IP Addressing
--------------------
For certain types of servers, you must assign a static IP address and
subnet mask during or after Setup. These servers include DHCP servers,
DNS servers, WINS servers, and any server providing access to users on
the Internet. It is also recommended that you assign a static IP
address and subnet mask for each domain controller. If a computer has
more than one network adapter, you must assign a separate IP address
for each adapter.

If you want to run Setup on a server before you have finalized your
decision about the static IP address you want to assign to that
server, you can choose "Typical settings" in the Networking Settings
dialog box during Setup and configure that server later. In this
situation, if there is a DHCP server in the network, Setup will obtain
an IP address configuration from DHCP. If there is no DHCP server in
the network, Setup will use Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA).
APIPA is described in the previous item in this list, "Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP)."

For more information about static IP addresses, including private IP
addresses (which you choose from certain ranges of addresses) and
public IP addresses (which you obtain from an Internet service
provider), see Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support
Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help
and Support.

After you have formed a plan for IP addressing, the next components
to consider are those for name resolution, which is the process of
mapping a computer name (something that users can recognize and
remember) to the appropriate IP address. The following sections
describe options for name resolution.

--------------------------------
5.2   Name Resolution for TCP/IP
--------------------------------
Name resolution is a process that provides users with
easy-to-remember server names, instead of requiring them to use the
numerical IP addresses by which servers identify themselves on the
TCP/IP network. The name-resolution services are Domain Name System
(DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).

DNS
---
DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers on
the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers are
needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet e-mail, Web
browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is often used as a name resolution
service in domains with clients running Windows 2000, Windows XP, or
products in the Windows Server 2003 family.

If you need to install DNS on a computer running Windows Server
2003, Web Edition, complete Setup and then use Add/Remove Windows
Components, which is part of Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel.

If you plan to install DNS on a server, specify a static IP address
on that server and configure that server to use that IP address for
its own name resolution. For information about assigning a static IP
address, see "Static IP Addressing" earlier in this text file. For
more information about configuring DNS, see Help and Support Center
(after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and
Support).

WINS
----
If you provide support for clients running Microsoft Windows NT or any
earlier Microsoft operating system, you might need to install Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the domain. You
might also need to install WINS if it is required by your applications. 
You can install WINS after Setup by using Add/Remove Windows Components, 
which is part of Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel.

If you plan to install WINS on a server, specify a static IP address
on that server. For information about assigning a static IP address,
see "Static IP Addressing" earlier in this text file. For more
information about configuring WINS, see Help and Support Center (after
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support).

======================================================================
6.0 DECIDING BETWEEN WORKGROUPS AND DOMAINS
======================================================================
A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies, and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended
choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.

In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one
for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use
different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and
permissions are simpler to keep track of, because a domain has a
single, centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other
network details. The information in this database is replicated
automatically among domain controllers. You determine which servers
are domain controllers and which are simply members of the domain. (A
server running Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, cannot be a
domain controller.) You can determine these roles not only during
Setup but afterward.

Domains, and the Active Directory directory service of which they are
a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to
users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more
information about Active Directory, see Help and Support Center (after
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support).
