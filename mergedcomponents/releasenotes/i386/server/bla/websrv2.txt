======================================================================
1.0 PREPARING YOUR SYSTEM FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
======================================================================
This section describes the basic steps to take in preparing your
server for a new installation.

----------------------------------------
1.1   Checking the System Log for Errors
----------------------------------------
If the computer already has a working operating system, review the
system log for recent or recurring errors (especially hardware errors)
that could cause problems during the installation. For information
about viewing event logs, see Help for the operating system on
your computer.

----------------------
1.2   Backing Up Files
----------------------
Before you perform a new installation, it is recommended that you
back up your current files, unless the computer has no files or the
current operating system files have been damaged. You can back up
files to a variety of different media, such as a tape drive or the
hard disk of another computer on the network.

-------------------------------
1.3   Disconnecting UPS Devices
-------------------------------
If you have an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected to your
target computer, disconnect the connecting serial cable before running
Setup. Setup automatically attempts to detect devices connected to
serial ports, and UPS equipment can cause problems with the detection
process.

======================================================================
2.0 STARTING SETUP
======================================================================
This section explains how to start Setup for a new installation.

Setup works in several stages, prompting you for information, copying
files, and restarting.

For important information to help you make the initial choices offered 
by Setup, see WebSrv1.TXT. For information about unattended Setup and 
other options available when you start Setup, see "Planning for 
Unattended Setup" later in this text file.

---------------------------------------------------
2.1   Providing a Mass Storage Driver or a HAL File
---------------------------------------------------
If you have a mass storage controller that requires a driver supplied
by the manufacturer, or if you have a custom Hardware Abstraction
Layer (HAL) file supplied by the manufacturer, provide the appropriate
driver file or HAL file during Setup.

2.1.1  Mass Storage Drivers and the Setup Process
-------------------------------------------------
If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID, or Fibre
Channel adapter) for your hard disk, confirm that the controller is
designed for products in the Windows Server 2003 family by checking 
the hardware and software compatibility information in the Windows 
Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

If your controller is compatible, but you are aware that the
manufacturer has supplied a separate driver file for use with products
in the Windows Server 2003 family, obtain the file (on a floppy disk) 
before you begin Setup. During the early part of Setup, a line at the 
bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6. Further prompts will 
guide you in supplying the driver file to Setup so that it can gain 
access to the mass storage controller.

If you are not sure whether you must obtain a separate driver file
from the manufacturer of your mass storage controller, you can try
running Setup. If the controller is not supported by the driver files
on the Setup CD and therefore requires a driver file that is supplied
by the hardware manufacturer, Setup stops and displays a message saying 
that no disk devices can be found, or it displays an incomplete list of 
controllers. After you obtain the necessary driver file, restart Setup,
and press F6 when you are prompted.

2.1.2  Using a Custom HAL File
-------------------------------
If you have a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied
by your computer manufacturer, before you begin Setup, locate the
floppy disk or other medium containing the file. During the early part
of Setup, a line at the bottom of the screen prompts you to press F6:
at this time press F5 (not F6). After you press F5, follow the prompts
to include your HAL file in the Setup process.

--------------------------------
2.2   Methods for Starting Setup
--------------------------------
The sections that follow, "Starting a New Installation from a CD" and
"Starting a New Installation from a Network," explain how to start
Setup for a new installation.

For information about unattended Setup and other options available
when you start Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup" later in
this text file.

2.2.1  Starting a New Installation from a CD
---------------------------------------------
If you use the Setup CD, you have several options for starting Setup,
as explained in the following procedures.

   Note: If you are running Setup on a computer running Windows 3.x or
   MS-DOS, for best efficiency, use disk caching. Otherwise, the Setup
   process (started from Winnt.exe) could take a long time. To enable
   disk caching on a computer running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, you can
   use SMARTDrive. For information about SMARTDrive, see the
   documentation for Windows 3.x or MS-DOS.

>>>TO START SETUP FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING MS-DOS

   1. Insert the CD in the drive.
 
   2. At the command prompt, type:

      d:

      where d is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

   3. Type:

      cd i386

   4. Type:

      winnt

   5. Follow the Setup instructions.

>>>TO START SETUP FROM THE CD ON A COMPUTER RUNNING WINDOWS

Before starting this procedure on a computer running
Windows NT 4.0, apply Service Pack 5 or later.

   1. Insert the CD in the drive.

   2. To begin Setup, do one of the following:

      * For a computer running any version of Windows other than
        Windows 3.x, wait for Setup to display a dialog box.

      * For a computer running Windows 3.x, use File Manager to change
        to the CD-ROM drive and to change to the I386 directory, and
        then double-click Winnt.exe.

   3. Follow the Setup instructions.

>> TO START SETUP FOR A NEW INSTALLATION FROM THE CD

Another way of using the Setup CD is to start the computer from the 
CD-ROM drive. Using this method, you can perform an installation on a
computer that does not have an operating system, although you can also
use this method on computers that have operating systems.

   1. Determine whether the computer on which you want to start Setup
      can be started from the CD-ROM drive.

   2. Insert the CD in the drive, and then restart the computer.

   3. Follow the instructions for your operating system to boot the
      computer from the CD.

   4. Wait for Setup to display a dialog box, and then follow the
      Setup instructions.

2.2.2  Starting a New Installation from a Network
-------------------------------------------------
To install Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, from a network, you
either share the files directly from the CD or copy them to a shared
folder. Then, you start the appropriate program to run Setup.

>>>TO INSTALL WINDOWS SERVER 2003, WEB EDITION, FROM A NETWORK

   1. On a network server, share the installation files, either by
      inserting the CD and sharing the CD-ROM drive or by copying the
      files from the I386 folder on the CD to a shared folder.

   2. On the computer on which you want to install Windows Server 2003,
      Web Edition, connect to the shared Setup files:

      * If you are sharing the CD-ROM drive, connect to the shared
        drive and change to the I386 folder.

      * If you are sharing a folder, connect to that folder.

   3. Find and run the appropriate file in the I386 directory of the
      CD or in the shared folder:

      * From a computer running MS-DOS or Windows 3.x, run Winnt.exe.

      * From a computer running Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98,
        Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT with Service Pack 5 or later,
        Windows 2000, or Windows XP, run Winnt32.exe.

   4. Follow the Setup instructions.

======================================================================
3.0 PLANNING FOR UNATTENDED SETUP
======================================================================
This section provides general information about unattended Setup. For
detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also called
automated installation), see "Automating and Customizing Installations"
in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can view the Windows
Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

To simplify the process of setting up a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family on multiple computers, you can run Setup
unattended. To do this, you create and use an answer file, a
customized script that answers the Setup questions automatically.
Then, you run Winnt32.exe or Winnt.exe with the appropriate options
for unattended Setup. Choose the command according to the operating
system that is running when you start unattended Setup:

   * To start unattended Setup on a computer running MS-DOS or
     Windows 3.x, use Winnt.exe (with the appropriate options).

   * To start unattended Setup on a computer running Windows 95,
     Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000,
     Windows XP, or a product in the Windows Server 2003 family,
     use Winnt32.exe (with the appropriate options). With Windows NT 4.0,
     before starting unattended Setup, apply Service Pack 5 or later.

To learn about unattended Setup, see the following sources:

   * For detailed instructions on running unattended Setup (also
     called automated installation): See "Automating and Customizing
     Installations" in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit
     (described in the first paragraph of this section).

   * To view the command options available for Winnt.exe: On a
     computer running Windows 3.x or MS-DOS, insert the Setup CD for
     Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, in the CD-ROM drive and
     open the command prompt. Then, change to the CD-ROM drive, change
     to the I386 directory, and type:

     winnt /?

   * To use an x86-based computer to view the command options
     available for Winnt32.exe: On a computer running Windows 95,
     Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT, Windows 2000,
     Windows XP, or a product in the Windows Server 2003 family,
     insert the Setup CD for Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, in
     the CD-ROM drive, and open the command prompt. Then, change to
     the CD-ROM drive, change to the I386 directory, and type:

     winnt32 /?

   * To use an Itanium architecture-based computer to view the command
     options available for Winnt32.exe: On an Itanium architecture-based
     computer running Windows XP 64-Bit Edition; the 64-bit version of
     Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; or the 64-bit version of 
     Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, insert the Setup CD for
     the 64-bit version of the product in the CD-ROM drive and open the
     command prompt (click Start, click Run, and then type cmd). Then,
     change to the CD-ROM drive, change to the IA64 directory, and type:

     winnt32 /?

======================================================================
4.0 ENTERING SERVER SETTINGS FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
======================================================================
After you start Setup, a process begins in which necessary Setup files 
are copied to the hard disk. During this process, Setup displays
dialog boxes that you can use to select various options.

The following sections outline the items that you specify as you run
Setup. Before working with these sections, see WebSrv1.TXT for
important background information about issues such as partitions, file
system choices, and the handling of TCP/IP name resolution.

   Note: If you have a mass storage controller (such as a SCSI, RAID,
   or Fibre Channel adapter) for your hard disk, see "Providing a Mass
   Storage Driver or a HAL File" earlier in this text file.
   If you have specialized hardware that requires a custom Hardware
   Abstraction Layer (HAL) file supplied by your computer manufacturer,
   see "Using a Custom HAL File" earlier in this text file.

Choosing or Creating a Partition for Windows Server 2003,
Web Edition
------------------------------------------------------------------
During a new installation of Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, a
dialog box gives you the opportunity to create or specify a partition
on which you want to install. You can create a partition from the
available unpartitioned space, specify an existing partition, or
delete an existing partition to create more unpartitioned disk space
for the new installation. If you specify any action that will cause
information to be erased, you will be prompted to confirm your choice.

For more information, see the section on planning partitions for new
installations in WebSrv1.TXT.

   IMPORTANT: If you delete an existing partition, all data on that
   partition is erased. Performing a new installation of Windows
   Server 2003, Web Edition, on a partition that contains another
   operating system overwrites the existing operating system.

Selecting Regional and Language Options
---------------------------------------
You can set up Windows Server 2003, Web Edition, to use multiple
languages and regional options.

If you select a European country or region in the list of
countries/regions, or if you live in a country or region where the
euro has been introduced, it is a good idea to verify that the default
currency settings in Regional and Language Options meet your needs.
After you run Setup, you can modify these options by clicking Regional
and Language Options in Control Panel.

Personalizing Windows
---------------------
Enter your name and, as an option, your organization.

Entering Your Computer Name
---------------------------
During Setup, in the Computer Name and Administrator Password dialog
box, follow the instructions for entering your computer name. The
recommended length for most languages is 15 characters or less. For
languages that require more storage space per character, such as
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the recommended length is 7 characters
or less.

It is recommended that you use only Internet-standard characters in
the computer name. The standard characters are the numbers from 0
through 9, uppercase and lowercase letters from A through Z, and the
hyphen (-) character. Computer names cannot consist entirely
of numbers.

If you are using DNS on your network, you can use a wider variety of
characters, including Unicode characters and other nonstandard
characters, such as the ampersand (&). Using nonstandard characters
might affect the ability of non-Microsoft software to operate on your
network. For more information about DNS, see "Name
Resolution for TCP/IP" in WebSrv1.TXT.

The maximum length for a computer name is 63 bytes. If the name is
longer than 15 bytes (15 characters in most languages, 7 characters in
some), computers running Windows NT Server 4.0 and earlier will
recognize this computer by the first 15 bytes of the name only. In
addition, there are additional configuration steps for a name that is
longer than 15 bytes. For more information, in Help and Support
Center, see "Namespace planning for DNS." To view Help and Support
Center, after running Setup, click Start, and then click Help
and Support.

If a computer is part of a domain, you must choose a computer name
that is different from any other computer in the domain. To avoid name
conflicts, the computer should be unique on the domain, workgroup, or
network. If this computer is part of a domain, and it contains more
than one operating system, you must use a unique computer name for
each operating system that is installed. For example, if the computer
name is FileServerNT when the computer is started with Windows NT
Server 4.0, the computer must have a different name, perhaps
FileServerNew, when it is started with a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family. This requirement also applies to a computer that
contains multiple installations of the same operating system. For more
information, in Help and Support Center, see "Planning your domain
structure."

Setting the Administrator Account Password
------------------------------------------
During Setup, in the Computer Name and Administrator Password dialog
box, type a password of up to 127 characters in the Administrator
Password box. For the strongest system security, use a password of at
least 7 characters, and use a mixture of uppercase and lowercase
letters, numbers, and other characters, such as *, ?, or $.

   IMPORTANT: After Setup is completed, for best security, change the
   name of the Administrator account (it cannot be deleted) and keep a
   strong password on the account at all times. For more information
   about security and the administrative rights and permissions held
   by the Administrator account and the Administrators group, see Help
   and Support Center. You can view Help and Support Center after
   Setup is complete by clicking Start, and then clicking Help
   and Support. 

Setting the Date and Time
-------------------------
During Setup, in the Date and Time Settings dialog box, set the date,
time, and time zone. If you want the system to automatically adjust
for daylight saving time, select the "Automatically adjust clock for
daylight saving changes" check box.

You can change your computer's date and time after Setup is complete.
If your computer is a member of a domain, your computer clock is
probably synchronized automatically by a network time server. If your
computer is not a member of a domain, you can synchronize your
computer clock with an Internet time server.

Specifying Networking Settings
------------------------------
You can specify networking information for TCP/IP or other protocols
during Setup, or you can use typical settings and then make any
necessary changes to your networking configuration after installation.

For basic background information about TCP/IP configuration and Setup,
see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution" in WebSrv1.TXT.

>>>TO ALLOW SETUP TO ASSIGN OR OBTAIN AN IP ADDRESS

   * When you click "Typical settings" in the Networking Settings
     dialog box, Setup checks to see if there is a DHCP server on your
     network. If there is a DHCP server on your network, DHCP provides
     an IP address. If there is no DHCP server on your network, Setup
     will use a limited IP addressing option called Automatic Private
     IP Addressing (APIPA). On a server using APIPA, complete the
     network configuration after Setup, because a server using APIPA
     can communicate only with other computers using APIPA on the same
     network segment.

     For basic background information about IP address configuration,
     including additional information about the limitations of APIPA,
     see "IP Addresses" in WebSrv1.TXT.

>>>TO SPECIFY A STATIC IP ADDRESS AND SETTINGS NEEDED FOR DNS AND WINS

   1. During Setup, in the Networking Settings dialog box, click
      "Custom settings," and then click Next.

   2. In the Networking Components dialog box, click Internet
      Protocol (TCP/IP).
  
   3. Click Properties.

   4. In the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties dialog box, click
      "Use the following IP address."

   5. In IP address, Subnet mask, and Default gateway, type the
      appropriate addresses.

   6. Under "Use the following DNS server addresses," type the address
      of a preferred DNS server and, optionally, an alternate
      DNS server.

      If the local server is the preferred or alternate DNS server,
      type the same IP address as assigned in the previous step.

   7. If you will use a WINS server, click Advanced, and then click
      the WINS tab in the Advanced TCP/IP Settings dialog box to add
      the IP address of one or more WINS servers.

   8. Click OK in each dialog box, and continue with Setup.

Specifying the Workgroup or Domain Name
---------------------------------------
A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an
administrator to control access to resources and keep track of users.

For more information about name conflicts, see "Entering Your
Computer Name" earlier in this text file.

======================================================================
5.0 CONFIGURING YOUR WEB SERVER
======================================================================
The Web Interface for Remote Administration is an HTML-based
application used to configure and manage the server from a remote
client. Individual servers, entire server farms, and multiple sites
per server can be managed from a single remote workstation.

The Web Interface for Remote Administration provides a simple means
of performing common Web server configuration tasks including:

   * Creating and deleting Web sites

   * Configuring network settings

   * Managing local user accounts

   * Restarting the Web server

5.1   Choosing Server Components
--------------------------------
You can use the Windows Components Wizard to select the appropriate
components for your server. To use this wizard, after running Setup,
click Start, and then click Control Panel. In Control Panel,
double-click Add or Remove Programs, and then, on the left side of the
dialog box, click Add/Remove Windows Components. With this wizard you
can choose and install individual components.

======================================================================
6.0 PRODUCT ACTIVATION FOR PRODUCTS IN THE
    WINDOWS SERVER 2003 FAMILY
======================================================================
After you install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family,
if the product was purchased individually rather than through a volume
licensing arrangement, you will have to activate the product unless
your hardware manufacturer has preactivated it for you. Product
activation is quick, simple, and unobtrusive, and it protects your
privacy. It is designed to reduce software piracy (illegal copies of a
product). Over time, reduced piracy means that the software industry
can invest more in product development, quality, and support. This
results in better products and more innovation for customers.

The following details help explain product activation:

Software reminders
------------------
Until you activate your product, it provides a reminder each time you
log on and at common intervals until the end of the activation grace
period stated in your End-User License Agreement (30 days is the
typical grace period). If your activation grace period passes and you
do not activate the product, your computer will continue to function,
except that when you log on locally or log on through Remote Desktop
for Administration (the new name for the Windows 2000 functionality
known as Terminal Services in Remote Administration Mode), you will
only be able to use the Activate Windows Wizard.

How the software handles activation
-----------------------------------
Activation is simple and anonymous. When you activate your product,
it means that your product key is now associated with the computer
(the hardware) it is installed on. After that happens, your product
key cannot be used for activation on other computers (unless you are
enrolled in a special program that permits additional activations, for
example, a program through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)).

Your local operating system does some of the work of creating the
association between your product key and the computer it is installed
on. It uses your Product ID, which is derived from your product key,
and puts it together with a coded number (called a hardware hash) that
uniquely represents the hardware components that make up your computer
(without representing any personal information or anything about the
software). When you activate, you provide this number, through the
Internet or by phone, so that it can be confirmed as representing a
legal installation. After you activate, if another person has an
illegal copy of your software, and that person tries to use your
product key to activate the software on another computer, the coded
numbers will show that your product key is already associated with a
particular set of hardware (your computer). The other person's
activation will not work.

The Installation ID that the local operating system generates,
representing the association between your product key and the computer
it is installed on, is used only for the purpose of activation.

Methods for activation
----------------------
After your operating system is installed, begin activation by
clicking Start, and then clicking Activate Windows. (You can also
click the key icon that appears in the lower right corner of the
screen.) By following the instructions on the screen, you can activate
through the Internet or by phone:

   * Internet: When you activate through the Internet, your computer
     transmits coded information that shows that your product key
     is associated with your computer hardware. Activation is
     carried out through a secure server. A confirmation ID is
     passed back to your computer, automatically activating your
     product. This process normally takes just a few seconds to
     complete. No personally identifiable information is required
     to activate your product.

   * Phone: When you activate by phone, information on the screen
     guides you through a few simple steps. When you choose the
     country or region where you are located, a phone number (toll-free,
     wherever possible) appears on your screen. When you call the
     number, a customer service representative asks for the
     Installation ID that is displayed on your screen. The customer
     service representative enters that number into a secure
     database, confirms that the number represents a legally
     installed product, and provides a confirmation ID to you. Then,
     you type the confirmation ID into the spaces provided on the
     screen, and activation is complete.

Reactivation (rarely needed)
----------------------------
If you overhaul your computer by replacing a substantial number of
hardware components (not just a few), the operating system might view
your hardware as a completely different computer, not the one on which
you activated. In this situation, you can call the telephone number
displayed on the telephone activation screen, and, through a quick,
simple process, you can reactivate your product.

---------------------------------------------------------
6.1   Product Activation Compared to Product Registration
---------------------------------------------------------
Product activation is not the same as product registration. As
discussed above, product activation is required, and it is completely
anonymous. Product registration, in contrast, is completely optional,
and it allows you to provide personal information, such as your e-mail
address, if you choose. Registration entitles you to receive
information about product updates and special offers directly from
Microsoft. All registration information provided is stored securely,
and no information is ever loaned or sold to other parties.
