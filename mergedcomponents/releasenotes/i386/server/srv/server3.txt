      OPERATING SYSTEM
======================================================================


On a computer with an appropriate disk configuration (outlined in the
table later in this section), you can install more than one operating
system, and then choose between the operating systems each time you
restart the computer. For example, you could set up a server to run
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, most of the time, but
allow it to sometimes run Windows NT Server 4.0 in order to support an
older application. (However, to do this you would need to make
specific file system choices and would need Service Pack 5 or later,
as described in "Multiple Operating Systems and File System
Compatibility" and "Choosing a File System for the Installation
Partition" later in this text file.) During restarts, a display would
appear for a specified number of seconds, allowing you to select
between the two operating systems. (You can specify a default
operating system that will run if no selection is made during the
restart process.)

The following table shows the disk configurations on which you can
install more than one operating system.

   IMPORTANT: You must follow the requirements in the following table.
   For example, on a basic disk, you must install each operating
   system, including Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, in a
   separate partition. This ensures that each operating system does
   not overwrite crucial files that are needed by another
   operating system.


======================================================================
DISK CONFIGURATION   REQUIREMENTS FOR MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic disk or disks  You can install multiple operating systems,
                     including Windows NT 4.0 and earlier
                     operating systems, on a basic disk. Each
                     operating system must be on a separate
                     partition or logical drive on the disk.

Single dynamic disk  You can install only one operating system.

                     However, if you used Microsoft Windows 2000 or
                     Microsoft Windows XP to change a disk with no
                     partitions directly to a dynamic disk, you must
                     revert the disk to basic before you can install
                     an operating system on it. For more information,
                     see "Working with Dynamic Disks and Setup" later
                     in this text file.

Multiple dynamic     Each dynamic disk can contain one installation
disks                of Windows 2000, Windows XP, or a product in
                     the Windows Server 2003 family. No other
                     operating systems can start from a dynamic disk.

                     However, if you used Windows 2000 or Windows XP
                     to change a disk with no partitions directly
                     to a dynamic disk, you must revert the disk
                     to basic before you can install an operating
                     system on it. For more information, see "Working
                     with Dynamic Disks and Setup" later in this text
                     file.


--------------------------------------------------
8.1   Reasons to Install Only One Operating System
--------------------------------------------------
Setting up a computer so that you can choose between two or more
operating systems at startup does have an advantage: it allows you to
use applications that run only with a particular operating system.
However, there are definite reasons to install only one
operating system:

   * Each operating system uses valuable disk space.

   * Compatibility issues, especially file system compatibility, can
     be complex. For more information, see "Multiple Operating Systems
     and File System Compatibility" later in this text file.

   * On a dynamic disk (a storage type available with products in the
     Windows Server 2003 family), you can have only one operating
     system per disk. Dynamic disks also will not work with some
     operating systems. For more information, see the table in the
     previous section, "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More
     Than One Operating System."

   * It is no longer necessary to maintain multiple operating systems
     as a safeguard against problems with starting the computer. With
     products in the Windows Server 2003 family, you have other
     options for system recovery. For example, if you have a problem
     with a newly installed device driver, you can use Safe Mode, in
     which Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, restarts with
     default settings and the minimum number of drivers. For more
     information about Safe Mode and other options for system
     recovery, see Help and Support Center.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
8.2   Requirements for Setting Up a Computer with Multiple Operating
      Systems
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you decide to set up a computer with more than one operating
system, review the following restrictions.

On computers that contain Microsoft Windows 98 or
Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition and
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition:

   * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
     install the applications used with an operating system on the
     same partition with it. If an application is used with two
     different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

   * Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition must be installed on a
     basic disk on a partition formatted with FAT or FAT32. If either
     Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition is not installed on the
     system partition, which is almost always the first partition on
     the disk, the system partition must also be formatted with FAT or
     FAT32.

   * Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, must be installed
     last. Otherwise important files that are needed for starting
     Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, could be overwritten.
   
   * File system compatibility might be an issue. See "Multiple
     Operating Systems and File System Compatibility" later in this
     text file.

On computers that contain Windows NT 4.0 and Windows Server 2003,
Standard Edition:

   * See "Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility"
     and "Computers That Contain Windows NT 4.0 and
     Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition," later in this
     text file.

On computers that contain some combination of Windows Server
2003, Standard Edition, with Windows 2000 or Windows XP, or that
contain multiple partitions with products in the Windows Server
2003 family:

   * Install each operating system on a different partition or, for
     dynamic disks, on a different disk, and install the applications
     used with an operating system on the same disk or partition with
     it. If an application is used with two different operating
     systems, install it in two places.

   * Choose any product in the Windows Server 2003 family for
     installation on a specific partition. For example, you could
     install Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, in one
     location and Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition,
     in another.

   * If Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition,
     are installed, Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, must
     be installed last. Otherwise important files that are needed for
     starting Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, could
     be overwritten.

   * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different
     computer name for each installation. Because a unique security
     identifier (SID) is used for each installation on a domain, the
     computer name for each installation must be unique, even for
     multiple installations on the same computer.

   * If you want to use the Encrypting File System (EFS), you must
     take certain steps to ensure that encrypted files will be
     available from each of the installations. For more information,
     see "Multiple Operating Systems and the Encrypting File System"
     later in this text file.


--------------------------------------------------------------
8.3   Multiple Operating Systems and File System Compatibility
--------------------------------------------------------------
On computers that contain multiple operating systems, compatibility
becomes more complex when you consider file system choices. The file
systems to choose from are NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. (For more
information, see "Choosing a File System for the Installation
Partition" later in this text file.)

NTFS is normally the recommended file system because it is more
efficient and reliable, and supports important features including
Active Directory and domain-based security. With NTFS, however, you
need to take file system compatibility into account when considering
whether to set up a computer to contain more than one operating
system, because with Windows 2000 and the Windows Server 2003
family, NTFS has new features in addition to those in Windows NT.
Files that use any new features will be completely usable or readable
only when the computer is started with Windows 2000 or a product in
the Windows Server 2003 family. For example, a file that uses the
new encryption feature will not be readable when the computer is
started with Windows NT Server 4.0, which was released before the
encryption feature existed. (For more information about features that
affect file accessibility with products in the Windows
Server 2003 family, see "NTFS" later in this text file.)

   IMPORTANT: If you want to set up a computer with both Windows NT
   and Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, and you want to
   have an NTFS partition, the only appropriate version of
   Windows NT is version 4.0 with the latest released Service Pack.
   Using the latest Service Pack maximizes compatibility between
   Windows NT 4.0 and Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition.
   (Specifically, you must have Service Pack 5 or later.) Even the
   latest Service Pack, however, does not provide access to files
   using the new features in NTFS.

Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains both
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, and Windows NT is not
recommended. On these computers, a FAT partition containing the
Windows NT 4.0 operating system ensures that when started with
Windows NT 4.0, the computer will have access to needed files. In
addition, if Windows NT is not installed on the system partition,
which is almost always the first partition on the disk, it is
recommended that the system partition also be formatted with FAT.

If you set up a computer so that it starts with Windows NT 3.51 or
earlier on a FAT partition, and Windows Server 2003,
Standard Edition, on an NTFS partition, when that computer starts with
Windows NT 3.51, the NTFS partition will not be visible. If you set up
a computer this way, and the partition containing Windows NT 3.51 is
not the system partition (which is almost always the first partition
on the disk), the system partition must also be formatted with FAT.


------------------------------------------------------------
8.4   Computers That Contain Windows NT 4.0 and Windows
      Server 2003, Standard Edition
------------------------------------------------------------
If you plan to set up a computer so that it contains Windows NT 4.0
and Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, first review the
following precautions:

   * It is no longer necessary to maintain multiple operating systems
     as a safeguard against problems with starting the computer. With
     products in the Windows Server 2003 family, you have other
     options for system recovery. For example, if you have a problem
     with a newly installed device driver, you can use Safe Mode, in
     which Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, restarts with
     default settings and the minimum number of drivers. For more
     information about Safe Mode and other options for system
     recovery, see Help and Support Center.

   * Using NTFS as the only file system on a computer that contains
     both Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, and Windows NT
     is not recommended. Follow the guidelines in "Multiple Operating
     Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this text file.
   
   * Make sure that Windows NT 4.0 has been updated with the latest
     released Service Pack. For details, see "Multiple Operating
     Systems and File System Compatibility" earlier in this text file.
   
   * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
     install the applications used with an operating system on the
     same partition with it. If an application is used with two
     different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

   * Do not install Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on a
     compressed drive unless the drive was compressed with the NTFS
     file system compression feature.

   * Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, must be installed
     last. Otherwise important files that are needed for starting
     Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, could be overwritten.
   
   * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different
     computer name for each installation.


---------------------------------------------------------------
8.5   Multiple Operating Systems and the Encrypting File System
---------------------------------------------------------------
If you set up a server so that it contains some combination of
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, with Windows 2000 or
Windows XP, or contains multiple partitions with products in the
Windows Server 2003 family, and you want to use the Encrypting
File System (EFS) on the computer, you must take certain steps. These
steps make encrypted files readable between the
different installations.

   * One approach is to ensure that all the installations are in the
     same domain and that the user of these installations has a
     roaming profile.

   * Another approach is to export the user's file encryption
     certificate and associated private key from one installation and
     import it into the other installations.

For more information about EFS, roaming user profiles, and importing
and exporting certificates, see Help and Support Center. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
click Help and Support.


======================================================================
9.0   CHOOSING A FILE SYSTEM FOR THE INSTALLATION PARTITION
======================================================================


You can choose among three file systems for an
installation partition: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is strongly
recommended in most situations.

   Note: You can use important features such as Active Directory and
   domain-based security only by choosing NTFS as your file system.

The following table lists a number of installation scenarios (the
last two scenarios are fairly uncommon) and provides file system
guidelines for each one:

The sections that follow provide information about reformatting or
converting a FAT or FAT32 partition to use NTFS, as well as additional
background information about NTFS, FAT, and FAT32.


--------------------------------------------------------
9.1   Reformatting or Converting a Partition to Use NTFS
--------------------------------------------------------
If you have a FAT or FAT32 partition on which you want to install a
product in the Windows Server 2003 family, and you want to use
NTFS instead, you have two choices:

   * You can convert the FAT or FAT32 partition to NTFS. This leaves
     files intact, although the partition may have somewhat more
     fragmentation and slower performance than a partition formatted
     with NTFS. However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS,
     regardless of whether the partition was formatted with NTFS
     or converted.

     If you install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family
     on a FAT or FAT32 partition, you are offered the option to
     convert the partition to NTFS. You can also convert a FAT or
     FAT32 partition after Setup by using Convert.exe. For more
     information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click
     Start, click Run, type cmd and then press ENTER. In the command
     window, type help convert, and then press ENTER.

   * You can reformat the partition with NTFS. This erases all files
     on the partition, but results in less fragmentation and better
     performance than with a converted partition.

If you format a partition during Setup, the file systems choices are
listed as NTFS and FAT. The following table provides information about
the relationship between partition size and file system choices during
Setup.

                                Windows Server 2003 family
                                continues to support
                                previously-formatted FAT32 partitions
                                of this size.


If you format a partition during Setup, you can choose between a quick
format and a full format:

Quick format
Quick format creates the file system structure on the disk without
verifying the integrity of every sector. Choose this method for any
disk that has no bad sectors and no history of file-corruption
problems that might be related to bad sectors.

Full format
A full format identifies and tracks bad sectors so that they are not
used for storing data. Choose this method for any disk that has bad
sectors or has a history of file-corruption problems that might be
related to bad sectors.


------------------------------------
9.2   NTFS Compared to FAT and FAT32
------------------------------------
NTFS has always been a more powerful file system than FAT and FAT32.
Windows 2000, Windows XP, and the Windows Server 2003 family
include a new version of NTFS, with support for a variety of features
including Active Directory, which is needed for domains, user
accounts, and other important security features. For more details
about features in NTFS, see "NTFS" later in this text file.

FAT and FAT32 are similar to each other, except that FAT32 is
designed for larger disks than FAT. The file system that works most
easily with large disks is NTFS.

The following table describes the compatibility of each file system
with various operating systems.

   Note: File system choices have no effect on access to files across
   the network. For example, using NTFS on all partitions on a server
   does not affect clients connecting across a network to shared
   folders or shared files on that server, even if those clients run
   an earlier operating system such as Windows 98 or Windows NT.

9.3   NTFS
----------
This section provides background information about the features
available with NTFS. Some of these features include:

   * Better scalability to large drives. The maximum partition or
     volume size for NTFS is much greater than that for FAT, and as
     volume or partition sizes increase, performance with NTFS does
     not degrade as it does with FAT.

   * Active Directory (and domains, which are part of Active
     Directory). With Active Directory, you can view and control
     network resources easily. With domains, you can fine-tune
     security options while keeping administration simple. Domain
     controllers and Active Directory require NTFS.

   * Compression features, including the ability to compress or
     uncompress a drive, a folder, or a specific file. (However, a
     file cannot be both compressed and encrypted at the same time.)

   * File encryption, which greatly enhances security. (However, a
     file cannot be both compressed and encrypted at the same time.)

   * Permissions that can be set on individual files rather than
     just folders.

   * Remote Storage, which provides an extension to your disk space by
     making removable media such as tapes more accessible. (This
     feature is not included with Windows Server 2003, Web
     Edition, or with Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition.)

   * Recovery logging of disk activities, which allows NTFS to restore
     information quickly in the event of power failure or other system
     problems.

   * Sparse files. These are very large files created by applications
     in such a way that only limited disk space is needed. That is,
     NTFS allocates disk space only to the portions of a file that are
     written to.

   * Disk quotas, which you can use to monitor and control the amount
     of disk space used by individual users.

This is only a partial list of the features in NTFS in the
Windows Server 2003 family.

For information about converting or reformatting a FAT or FAT32
partition, see "Reformatting or Converting a Partition to Use NTFS"
earlier in this text file.


======================================================================
10.0   PLANNING DISK PARTITIONS OR VOLUMES FOR NEW INSTALLATIONS
======================================================================


You must plan your disk partitions before you run Setup only if both
of the following conditions are true:

   * You are performing a new installation, not an upgrade.

   * The disk on which you are installing is a basic disk, not a
     dynamic disk. Basic disks are the disk type that existed before
     Windows 2000; most disks are basic disks. Dynamic disks are disks
     that once were basic but were changed to dynamic using Windows
     2000, Windows XP, or a product in the Windows Server 2003
     family. If you plan to install to a dynamic disk, you cannot
     change the volume or partition sizes on the disk during Setup,
     and therefore no planning is needed regarding partition sizes.
     Instead, review the guidelines in "Working with Dynamic Disks and
     Setup" later in this text file.

Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that
each section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions
on a basic disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can
be formatted for use by a file system, such as FAT or NTFS.
Different partitions often have different drive letters (for example,
C: and D:). A basic disk can have up to four primary partitions, or
three primary partitions and one extended partition. (An extended
partition can be subdivided into logical drives, while a primary
partition cannot be subdivided.)

   IMPORTANT: If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard
   disk, be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand, because
   these actions will destroy any existing data. As with any major
   change to disk contents, it is recommended that you back up the
   entire contents of the hard disk before working with partitions,
   even if you plan to leave one or more of your partitions alone.

Do not install Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on a
compressed drive unless the partition was compressed with the NTFS
file system compression feature. (Uncompress a DriveSpace or
DoubleSpace drive before running Setup on it.)

Before you run Setup to perform a new installation, determine the
size of the partition on which to install. There is no set formula for
figuring a partition size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of
room for the operating system, applications, and other files that you
plan to put on the installation partition. The files for setting up
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, require approximately 1.25
GB to 2 GB, as described in "System Requirements" in Server1.TXT. It
is recommended that you allow considerably more disk space than the
minimum amount. It is not unreasonable to allow 4 GB to 10 GB on the
partition, or more for large installations. This allows space for a
variety of items, including optional components, user accounts, Active
Directory information, logs, future service packs, the paging file
used by the operating system, and other items.

When you perform a new installation, you can specify the partition on
which to install. If you specify a partition on which another
operating system exists, you will be prompted to confirm your choice.

During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to
install Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition. After installation
is complete, you can use Disk Management to manage new and existing
disks and volumes. This includes creating new partitions from
unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming, and reformatting
existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks; and changing a
basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic to basic. (If
you want to have a dynamic disk on a computer that contains more than
one operating system, be sure to read "Deciding Whether a Computer
Will Contain More Than One Operating System" earlier in this text
file.)

   IMPORTANT: If you are setting up a computer so that it contains
   multiple operating systems, you must install
   Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on its own partition
   or logical drive. This ensures that Windows Server 2003,
   Standard Edition, will not overwrite crucial files that are needed
   by the other operating system. For more information, see "Deciding
   Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating System"
   earlier in this text file.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
10.1   Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services
-------------------------------------------------------------------
If you plan to use Remote Installation Services on this server so
that you can install operating systems onto other computers, a
separate partition for use by Remote Installation Services is
necessary. Plan on using NTFS on this partition: NTFS is required for
the Single Instance Store feature of Remote Installation Services.

If you need to create a new partition for Remote Installation
Services, plan on doing it after Setup, and leave enough unpartitioned
disk space so that you can create it (at least 4 GB of space is
recommended). As an alternative, you can plan to make the disk a
dynamic disk, which allows more flexibility in the use of the disk
space than a basic disk. (However, if you want to have a dynamic disk
on a computer that contains more than one operating system, see
"Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating
System" earlier in this text file.)

For more information about Remote Installation Services and about
disk and partition choices, see Help and Support Center. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
click Help and Support.

---------------------------------------
10.2   Options When Partitioning a Disk
---------------------------------------
You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup only if you
are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. You can modify the
partitioning of the disk after Setup by using Disk Management.

If you are performing a new installation, Setup examines the hard
disk to determine its existing configuration, and then offers the
following options:

   * If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the
     partition on which you will install a product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family.

   * If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned disk
     space, you can create the partition for your
     Windows Server 2003 family product by using the
     unpartitioned space.

   * If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough,
     you can install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family
     on that partition, with or without reformatting the partition
     first. Reformatting a partition erases all data on the partition.
     If you do not reformat the partition, but you do install a
     Windows Server 2003 family product where there is already an
     operating system, that operating system will be overwritten, and
     you must reinstall any applications you want to use with the
     Windows Server 2003 family product.

   * If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to
     create more unpartitioned disk space for a partition for a
     product in the Windows Server 2003 family. Deleting an
     existing partition also erases any data on that partition.


-------------------------------------------
10.3   Working with Dynamic Disks and Setup
-------------------------------------------
A dynamic disk is a disk using the new storage type introduced with
Windows 2000. If you changed a disk to dynamic and you want to perform
a new installation on the disk, review the following.

   * If you used Windows 2000 or Windows XP to change a disk with no
     partitions directly to a dynamic disk, you must revert the disk
     to basic before you can install an operating system on it.

        CAUTION: All data will be lost in the process of reverting the
        disk to basic, so back it up first.

You can use Windows 2000 or Windows XP to revert the disk, or you can
use the Setup program for a product in the Windows Server 2003
family. To use Windows 2000 or Windows XP, follow the instructions in
Help for your operating system. To use Setup for a product in the
Windows Server 2003 family, during the partitioning phase, find
the dynamic disk among the list of available partitions and then
delete it (which erases all data on all volumes). You will be prompted
to confirm your action. After you do this, the disk will contain only
unpartitioned space, and you can use Setup to create a new (basic
disk) partition on it.

   * If you plan to rerun Setup on a computer on which a product in
     the Windows Server 2003 family was already installed, and
     the computer contains dynamic disks, be sure to read about the
     limitations for installing operating systems on disks that are
     changed to dynamic using a product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family. For more information, see topics
     about dynamic disks and the partition table in Help and Support
     Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup,
     click Start, and then click Help and Support.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
10.4   Working with Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets
       with Parity
-----------------------------------------------------------------
If you used Windows NT 4.0 to create a volume set, mirror set, stripe
set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on that computer, you
must prepare the disk set first. For details, see "Working with
Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets, or Stripe Sets with Parity"
in Server2.TXT.


======================================================================
11.0   NETWORKS: TCP/IP, IP ADDRESSES, AND NAME RESOLUTION
======================================================================


TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access.

To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP
address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through
software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these
addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also
have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this
type of name to an IP address is called name resolution, and can be
accomplished by various methods, primarily the Domain Name System
(DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The following sections
provide more information.

For detailed information about TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS, and WINS, see Help
and Support Center as well as the Windows Server 2003 Resource
Kit. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click
Start, and then click Help and Support.

You can also view Help and Support Center topics on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/


-------------------
11.1   IP Addresses
-------------------
As outlined in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an
IP address be provided for each computer. This section describes IP
addressing options. There are two basic approaches for providing an IP
address for a server you are installing:

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
------------------------------------------
You can provide IP addresses to the computers on your network by
configuring one or more DHCP servers, which provide IP addresses
dynamically to other computers. A DHCP server must itself be assigned
a static IP address.

One server or several servers can provide DHCP along with one or more
name resolution services, which are called Domain Name System (DNS)
and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The name resolution services
are described in the next section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP."

If you want to run Setup before you have finalized your decisions
about which server to use as your DHCP server and what static IP
address to assign to that server, you can choose "Typical settings" in
the Networking Settings dialog box during Setup and complete the
network configuration later. If you do this and there is no DHCP
server in the network, Setup will use a limited IP addressing option
called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). During the time that a
server is using APIPA, it can communicate only with other computers
using APIPA on the same network segment. A server that is using APIPA
cannot make connections to the Internet (for browsing or e-mail), and
cannot be used with DNS or Active Directory (which depends on DNS).

If you know which server you want to use as your DHCP server, when
installing that server, in the Networking Settings dialog box in
Setup, choose "Custom settings," and specify a static IP address and
related network settings. For more information about how to do this,
see "Specifying Networking Settings" in Server4.TXT.

Static IP addressing
--------------------
For certain types of servers, you must assign a static IP address and
subnet mask during or after Setup. These servers include DHCP servers,
DNS servers, WINS servers, and any server providing access to users on
the Internet. It is also recommended that you assign a static IP
address and subnet mask for each domain controller. If a computer has
more than one network adapter, you must assign a separate IP address
for each adapter.

If you want to run Setup on a server before you have finalized your
decision about the static IP address you want to assign to that
server, you can choose "Typical settings" in the Networking Settings
dialog box during Setup and configure that server later. In this
situation, if there is a DHCP server in the network, Setup will obtain
an IP address configuration from DHCP. If there is no DHCP server in
the network, Setup will use Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA).
APIPA is described in the previous item in this list, "Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP)."

For more information about static IP addresses, including private IP
addresses (which you choose from certain ranges of addresses) and
public IP addresses (which you obtain from an Internet service
provider), see Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support
Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help
and Support.


---------------------------------
11.2   Name Resolution for TCP/IP
---------------------------------
Name resolution is a process that provides users with easy-to-remember
server names, instead of requiring them to use the numerical
IP addresses by which servers identify themselves on the TCP/IP
network. The name-resolution services are Domain Name System (DNS) and
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).

DNS
---
DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers on
the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers are
needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet e-mail, Web
browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is often used as a name resolution
service in domains with clients running Windows 2000, Windows XP, or
products in the Windows Server 2003 family.

DNS is installed automatically when you create a domain controller
(or when you install Active Directory on an existing member server,
which makes it a domain controller), unless the software
for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, detects that a DNS
server already exists for that domain. You can also install DNS by
choosing the DNS server role in Manage Your Server or by using
Add/Remove Windows Components, which is part of Add or Remove
Programs in Control Panel.

If you plan to install DNS on a server, specify a static IP address
on that server and configure that server to use that IP address for
its own name resolution.

WINS
----
If you provide support for clients running Windows NT or any earlier
Microsoft operating system, you might need to install Windows Internet
Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the domain. You might
also need to install WINS if it is required by your applications. You
can install WINS after Setup by choosing the WINS server role in
Manage Your Server or by using Add/Remove Windows Components, which is
part of Add or Remove Programs in Control Panel.

If you plan to install WINS on a server, specify a static IP address
on that server.


======================================================================
12.0   DECIDING BETWEEN WORKGROUPS AND DOMAINS
======================================================================


A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies, and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended
choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.

In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one
for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use
different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and
permissions are simpler to keep track of, because a domain has a
single, centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other
network details. The information in this database is replicated
automatically among domain controllers. You determine which servers
are domain controllers and which are simply members of the domain. You
can determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.

Domains, and the Active Directory directory system of which they are
a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to
users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more
information about Active Directory, see Help and Support Center (after
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support).

You can also view Help and Support Center topics on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/


---------------------------------------------------------
12.1   Planning for Domain Controllers and Member Servers
---------------------------------------------------------
With Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition;
Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; or Windows
Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, servers in a domain can have one of
two roles: domain controllers, which contain matching copies of the
user accounts and other Active Directory data in a given domain, and
member servers, which belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of
the Active Directory data. (A server that belongs to a workgroup, not
a domain, is called a stand-alone server.) It is possible to change
the role of a server back and forth from domain controller to member
server (or stand-alone server), even after Setup is complete. However,
it is recommended that you plan your domain before running Setup and
change server roles (and server names) only when necessary.

Multiple domain controllers provide better support for users,
compared to a single domain controller. With multiple domain
controllers, you have multiple copies of user account data and other
Active Directory data; however, it is still important to perform
regular backups, including Automated System Recovery backups, and
familiarize yourself with the methods for restoring a domain
controller. In addition, multiple domain controllers work together to
support domain controller functions, such as carrying out logon
validations. For more information about domain controllers and other
Active Directory topics, see Help and Support Center (after completing
Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support).
