-----------------------------------------------------
5.1   Stages in the Process of Upgrading Servers in a
      Windows NT 4.0 Domain
-----------------------------------------------------
There are three stages to the process of upgrading servers in a
domain where all the domain controllers run Windows NT 4.0:

Basic preparations
------------------
There are a small number of basic preparations you must carry out
before upgrading servers to a product in the Windows Server 2003
family, such as confirming hardware compatibility and reviewing the
partitioning of the disks on the servers. For more information, see
"Basic Preparations for the Upgrade of Servers in a Windows NT Domain"
later in this text file.

Planning server roles and the order in which to upgrade servers
---------------------------------------------------------------
Planning server roles and the order in which to upgrade servers
involves understanding the server roles available, as well as deciding
when to upgrade domain controllers in relation to member servers:

   * The server roles available for servers running Windows NT are
     slightly different than for servers running Windows Server 2003.
     Also, in contrast with servers running Windows NT, you can change
     the role of a server running Windows Server 2003 without 
     reinstalling the operating system. For more information, see 
     "Planning Server Roles and the Order of Server Upgrades from 
     Windows NT" later in this text file.

   * If the first server running Windows NT 4.0 you upgrade is a
     member server, many features become available immediately. For
     information about reasons for upgrading a particular member
     server early in the process, see "Features Available with the
     Upgrade of Any Server in a Windows NT Domain" later in this
     text file.

   * When you upgrade the primary domain controller, many Active
     Directory features become available (in addition to all the
     other features in the Windows Server 2003 family). For
     information about how these features can simplify
     administration, see "Features Available with the First Domain
     Controller Upgrade in a Windows NT Domain" later in this text
     file.

     However, the upgrade to Active Directory also involves some
     advance planning. For information about the planning necessary
     before upgrading to Active Directory, see "Planning DNS for
     the Upgrade of Domain Controllers Running Windows NT 4.0" later
     in this text file.

        IMPORTANT: When you begin the upgrade of domain controllers
        running Windows NT 4.0, you must upgrade the primary
        domain controller first.


Performing backups and carrying out the upgrade process
-------------------------------------------------------
There are a few preparations to make just before beginning the
upgrades, such as ensuring that you have applied Service Pack 5 or
later, and performing backups:

   * For information about the preparations to make just before
     beginning the upgrade, see "Applying the Service Pack,
     Performing Backups, and Other Preparations" later in this text
     file.

   * For information about choices to make during the upgrade of the
     primary domain controller, see "Running the Active Directory
     Installation Wizard After Upgrading the Primary Domain
     Controller" later in this text file.

   * For information on Help and Support Center topics about Active
     Directory, see "Learning About Active Directory After the First
     Server is Upgraded" later in this text file. You can also view
     the topics about Active Directory at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

   * For guidelines regarding further upgrades, see "Completing
     Further Upgrades from Windows NT 4.0" later in this text file.
     

--------------------------------------------------------
5.2   Basic Preparations for the Upgrade of Servers in a
      Windows NT Domain
--------------------------------------------------------
There are a small number of basic preparations you must carry out to
lay the groundwork for upgrading servers in a domain where all the
domain controllers run Windows NT 4.0. For information about how these
preparations fit into the overall process of the upgrade, see "Stages
in the Process of Upgrading Servers in a Windows NT 4.0 Domain"
earlier in this text file.

   IMPORTANT: If you have servers or client computers that run
   Windows NT 3.51, it is recommended that you install or upgrade to
   a newer operating system on all these computers, or retire them
   from operation. If you have more than one domain, you must upgrade
   domain controllers running Windows NT 3.51 for reliable logon
   validation. In any case, upgrading or retiring computers running
   Windows NT 3.51 strengthens security and reduces the number of
   version differences between computers, simplifying management and
   troubleshooting.


Compatibility check
-------------------
Check to see whether the applications and hardware on your systems
are compatible with products in the Windows Server 2003 family,
and then update or replace them as necessary. For important details
about how to do this, see "Hardware Compatibility" and "Important
Files to Review" in Server1.TXT.


Review partition sizes, especially on domain controllers
--------------------------------------------------------
Review the partitions on the servers to make sure there is plenty of
free space available for the Windows Server 2003 operating system to
run. It is especially important to allow plenty of free space on
domain controllers, because the existing user accounts database can
expand by as much as a factor of ten when Active Directory
functionality is added. For information about the disk requirements
for the operating system, see "System Requirements" in Server1.TXT.


Review file systems on server partitions
----------------------------------------
You must have at least one NTFS partition on domain controllers. It
is recommended that you use NTFS on all partitions on all the servers
in the domain, because any FAT or FAT32 partition lacks many security
features. For example, on FAT or FAT32 partitions, a shared folder can
be protected only by the permissions set on the shared folder, not on
individual files, and there is no software protection against local
access to the partition. For more information, see "Choosing a File
System for the Installation Partition" and "Reformatting or Converting
a Partition to Use NTFS" in Server3.TXT.


Service pack
------------
Obtain Service Pack 5 or later, because it is necessary for
the upgrade.


Mirror sets or other disk sets
------------------------------
If you used Windows NT 4.0 to create a volume set, mirror set, stripe
set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on that computer, you must
prepare the disk set first. For details, see "Working with Volume,
Mirror, or Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets with Parity" later in this text
file.


5.2.1  Working with Volume, Mirror, or Stripe Sets or Stripe Sets
       with Parity
------------------------------------------------------------------
With the disk management technologies in Windows NT 4.0, you could
create volume sets, mirror sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with
parity, each with specific capabilities and limitations. By using the
dynamic disk technology introduced with Windows 2000, you can use
similar technologies, with the added flexibility of being able to
extend disk volumes without repartitioning or reformatting.

This transition from the technologies used in Windows NT 4.0 means
that you must make certain choices before running Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition. Any volume sets, mirror
sets, stripe sets, or stripe sets with parity that you created with
Windows NT 4.0 are not supported in Windows Server 2003,
Standard Edition, although they were supported to a limited extent in
Windows 2000.

If you used Windows NT 4.0 to create a volume set, mirror set, stripe
set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup for
Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on that computer, you must
choose one of the following methods.


For a mirror set, break the mirror
----------------------------------
If you are running Windows NT 4.0 on a computer that has a mirror set
and you want to run Setup for Windows Server 2003, Standard
Edition, on that computer, first back up the data (as a safeguard --
the data will not be erased) and then break the mirror. Ensure that
you have applied Service Pack 5 or later, required before running
Setup for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition. Then run Setup.


For a volume set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, back up the
data and delete the set
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are running Windows NT 4.0 on a computer that has a volume
set, stripe set, or stripe set with parity, and you want to run Setup
for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on that computer,
first back up the data. Next, delete the set (which will delete the
data). Ensure that you have applied Service Pack 5 or later, required
before running Setup for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition.
Then run Setup.

After running Setup for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition,
you can make the disk dynamic, restore backed-up data as necessary,
and make use of the volume options shown in the table later in this
section. For more information about dynamic disks, see Help and
Support Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing
Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.


If necessary, use the Ftonline support tool
-------------------------------------------
The preceding methods are the recommended methods for preparing to
run Setup for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, on a
computer that contains a volume set, mirror set, stripe set, or stripe
set with parity created with Windows NT 4.0. However, if you do not
use these methods and you must access one of these sets after running
Setup for Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, you can use the
Ftonline tool. The Ftonline tool is part of the Windows
Server 2003 family Support Tools. For more information, see topics on
Support Tools and on Ftonline in Help and Support Center. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click
Help and Support.


Types of Multidisk Volumes on Dynamic Disks
-------------------------------------------
The disk sets described in the previous section have different names
in the Windows Server 2003 family than they had in
Windows NT 4.0:


======================================================================
WINDOWS NT 4.0 NAME            WINDOWS SERVER 2003 FAMILY NAME
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Volume set                     Spanned volume on a dynamic disk
Mirror set                     Mirrored volume on a dynamic disk
Stripe set                     Striped volume on a dynamic disk
Stripe set with parity         RAID-5 volume on a dynamic disk


-----------------------------------------------------------------
5.3   Planning Server Roles and the Order of Server Upgrades from
      Windows NT
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This section provides a list of basic guidelines to use when planning
server roles and the order of server upgrades in a domain where all
the domain controllers run Windows NT 4.0. For information about how
this planning fits into the overall process of the upgrade, see
"Stages in the Process of Upgrading Servers in a Windows NT 4.0
Domain" earlier in this text file.

Use the following guidelines when planning server roles and the order
of server upgrades from Windows NT:

   * Familiarize yourself with the slight differences between the
     naming of server roles for servers running Windows NT as compared
     to servers running Windows Server 2003:

     * In Windows NT, there are two kinds of domain controllers, the
       primary domain controller, which is limited to one per domain
       and contains a read-write database, and the backup domain
       controller, which is not limited in number and contains a
       read-only database.

     * For domain controllers running Windows Server 2003, there is 
       only one kind of domain controller, without a "primary" or
       "backup" designation. All domain controllers contain matching
       copies of the user accounts and other Active Directory data 
       in a given domain, and provide read-write access to that data.

     * In addition to domain controllers, the possible roles for
       either operating system include member server, which belongs
       to a domain but does not contain a copy of the Active Directory
       data, and stand-alone server, which belongs to a workgroup
       instead of a domain.

   * Note that in contrast with Windows NT, you can change the role of
     a server without rerunning Setup. However, as a general practice,
     it is best to plan the roles ahead of time and change them only
     as necessary.

   * As was true with Windows NT, a domain must have at least one
     domain controller, but it is recommended that a domain have
     multiple domain controllers for resilience in the handling of
     logon requests and directory updates.

   * If the features you need most are not Active Directory features,
     you can focus on upgrading member servers first. For information
     about reasons for upgrading a particular member server early in
     the process, see "Features Available with the Upgrade of Any
     Server in a Windows NT Domain" later in this text file.

   * If the features you need most are Active Directory features,
     focus on upgrading domain controllers first, and carry out the
     advance planning that is necessary for this part of the upgrade.
 
        IMPORTANT: When you begin the upgrade of domain controllers
        running Windows NT 4.0, you must upgrade the primary domain
        controller first.

For information about the features that come with Active Directory,
see "Features Available with the First Domain Controller Upgrade in a
Windows NT Domain" later in this text file. For information about the
planning necessary before upgrading to Active Directory, see "Planning
DNS for the Upgrade of Domain Controllers Running Windows NT 4.0"
later in this text file.

   * When you begin upgrading domain controllers, if you have a remote
     access server that is a member server, it is recommended that you
     upgrade it before the last domain controller is upgraded. Such a
     server is dependent on domain controllers for user information,
     and therefore should not be "left behind" when domain controllers
     are upgraded. As an alternative, you can weaken the security
     permissions in Active Directory so that the remote access server
     running Windows NT can read user attributes from the domain
     controllers running products in the Windows Server 2003
     family. For more information, see the Windows Server 2003
     Deployment Kit.


5.3.1  Features Available with the Upgrade of Any Server in a
       Windows NT Domain
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you are interested in the features in the following list, you
might want to focus on upgrading the member servers in your
Windows NT 4.0 domain. For information about reasons to upgrade the
domain controllers, see "Features Available with the First Domain
Controller Upgrade in a Windows NT Domain" later in this text file.

   * Management tools:
  
     Microsoft Management Console
     Plug and Play
     Device Manager
     Add Hardware Wizard (in Control Panel)
     Support for Universal Serial Bus
     Enhanced Backup utility

   * File system support: The version of NTFS in the Windows
     Server 2003 family includes support for disk quotas, the ability
     to defragment directory structures, and compressed network I/O.

   * Application services: Win32 Driver Model, DirectX 7.0, and
     Windows Script Host.

   * Printer protocol support: Device and protocol support allowing
     choices from more than 2,500 different printers. Other printing
     enhancements are included, for example, Internet Printing
     Protocol support, which allows users to print directly to a URL
     over an intranet or the Internet.

   * Scalability and availability: Improved symmetric multiprocessor
     support as compared to Windows NT.

   * Security: Encrypting File System.


5.3.2  Features Available with the First Domain Controller Upgrade
       in a Windows NT Domain
------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are interested in the features in the following list, all of
which are features of Active Directory, focus on upgrading the primary
domain controller, as opposed to member servers. (The first domain
controller that you upgrade must be the primary domain controller. It
is recommended that you also upgrade backup domain controllers.) For
information about the DNS planning necessary before beginning the
upgrade of domain controllers running Windows NT, see "Planning DNS
for the Upgrade of Domain Controllers Running Windows NT 4.0" later in
this text file.

For information about reasons to upgrade member servers, see
"Features Available with the Upgrade of Any Server in a Windows NT
Domain" earlier in this text file.

After running Setup, you can also display topics about Active
Directory and other feature areas in Help and Support Center (click
Start, and then click Help and Support).

   Note: When a domain controller is upgraded, it has all the features
   of the Windows Server 2003 family, which means it has all the
   features in the following list, plus the features in "Features
   Available with the Upgrade of Any Server in a Windows NT Domain"
   earlier in this text file.

When you upgrade a domain controller to run a Windows Server 2003
operating system instead of Windows NT, many Active Directory features
become available in the domain:

   * Simplified management of network-resource information and
     user information.

   * Group Policy, which you can use to set policies that apply across
     a given site, domain, or organizational unit in Active Directory.
   
   * Security and authentication features, including support for
     Kerberos V5, Secure Sockets Layer 3.0, and Transport Layer
     Security using X.509v3 certificates.

   * Directory consolidation, through which you can organize and
     simplify the management of users, computers, applications, and
     devices, and make it easier for users to find the information
     they want. You can take advantage of synchronization support
     through interfaces based on the Lightweight Directory Access
     Protocol (LDAP), and work with directory consolidation
     requirements specific to your applications.

   * Directory-enabled applications and infrastructure, which make it
     easier to configure and manage applications and other
     directory-enabled network components.

   * Scalability without complexity, a result of Active Directory
     scaling to millions of objects per domain and using indexing
     technology and advanced replication techniques to
     speed performance.

   * Use of Internet standards, including access through Lightweight
     Directory Access Protocol and a namespace based on the Domain
     Name System (DNS).

   * Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI), a powerful
     development environment.

   * Additional Active Directory features.


5.3.3  Planning DNS for the Upgrade of Domain Controllers Running
       Windows NT 4.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical naming system used for
locating computers on the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. This
section describes the planning for DNS that is recommended before you
upgrade to Active Directory, that is, before you upgrade the primary
domain controller in a Windows NT domain to become a domain controller
running Windows Server 2003.

DNS is the name resolution service used by Active Directory. Products
in the Windows Server 2003 family can support both the Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) common in Windows NT networks, and DNS.
You must deploy DNS to support Active Directory. You can choose to
migrate from WINS to DNS or configure your new DNS infrastructure to
support your current WINS infrastructure.

For the upgrading of a network with one to five servers and 100 or
fewer clients (which is the size of network discussed in this text
file series), only a simple DNS plan is needed, because there will be
no parent or child domains. (For information about upgrading networks
with more than five servers, see the Windows Server 2003
Deployment Kit.) DNS names consist of name labels separated by
periods. A simple DNS domain name for a Windows Server 2003
family domain could take the form domainname.ext where ext is an
established "top-level domain" type such as com or org. With a domain
name of that form, the form of a computer name in the domain would be:

computername.domainname.ext

When you upgrade the primary domain controller in a Windows NT 4.0
domain (the primary domain controller must be upgraded first, before
backup domain controllers), you will be offered several different
options for the handling of DNS. If there is no DNS server available
to work with Active Directory, you will be offered, by default, the
option of installing DNS on the domain controller you are upgrading
(formerly the primary domain controller). In a network with one to
five servers, the simplest approach is to accept this default. Then,
after completing the upgrade of the server on which DNS was installed,
take note of its static IP address, and configure other computers to
send any DNS requests to that IP address. For additional basic
information about DNS and how to configure it during Setup, see "Name
Resolution for TCP/IP" in Server3.TXT. For more detailed information
about DNS, see the Windows Deployment and Resource Kits as well as
Help and Support Center. One way to view these sources of information
is to work from any computer that has Internet access (regardless of
the operating system running on that computer). You can view these
sources of information at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

Another way to view information about DNS is to go to a computer
running any product in the Windows Server 2003 family, click
Start, and then click Help and Support.


------------------------------------------------------------
5.4   Performing Backups and Carrying out Upgrades of Domain
      Controllers Running Windows NT 4.0
------------------------------------------------------------
There are a few preparations to make just before beginning an upgrade
from Windows NT 4.0, such as ensuring that you have applied Service
Pack 5 or later, and performing backups. During the upgrade, there are
a few choices to make for the upgrade of a network of two to five
servers (a network within the size of those discussed in this text
file series). The following sections describe these final preparations
and provide guidelines for making choices.

Before beginning this stage of the upgrade process, be sure to review
"Basic Preparations for the Upgrade of Servers in a Windows NT Domain"
and "Planning Server Roles and the Order of Server Upgrades from
Windows NT" earlier in this text file.


5.4.1  Applying the Service Pack, Performing Backups, and Other
       Preparations
---------------------------------------------------------------
Before beginning an upgrade of servers in a domain where all the
domain controllers run Windows NT 4.0, apply an appropriate Service
Pack, perform backups, and consider whether to remove a backup domain
controller temporarily from the network:

   * Be sure that you have applied Service Pack 5 or later to the
     servers. You must apply Service Pack 5 or later before you can
     begin an upgrade from Windows NT 4.0.

   * As with any major change to the contents of hard disks on your
     servers, it is recommended that you back up each server before
     upgrading it. Also be sure to review "Preparing Your System for
     an Upgrade" in Server4.TXT.

   * If you are preparing to upgrade the primary domain controller, to
     protect your existing network integrity, consider removing a
     backup domain controller temporarily from the network. To do
     this, in your existing Windows NT network, choose a backup domain
     controller, ensure that it has a current copy of the user
     accounts database, and back it up. Then disconnect its network
     cable. After the upgrade of your primary domain controller to
     become a domain controller running Windows Server 2003 (you must
     upgrade the primary domain controller first), this disconnected
     system is available for promotion to a Windows NT primary domain
     controller if necessary. However, in the course of an uneventful
     upgrade, you would not and could not promote the Windows NT
     backup domain controller to primary domain controller. Instead,
     you would continue the upgrade process, eventually reconnecting
     the disconnected server and upgrading it.


5.4.2  Running the Active Directory Installation Wizard After
       Upgrading the Primary Domain Controller
-------------------------------------------------------------
To upgrade the primary domain controller to become a domain
controller running Windows Server 2003, you must first run Setup to
upgrade the operating system. After the operating system is installed,
you can run the Active Directory Installation Wizard (which appears on
the screen the first time you log on). This section provides guidelines
for making choices in the Active Directory Installation Wizard when
upgrading the primary domain controller.

For information about preparations necessary before beginning the
upgrade, see "Stages in the Process of Upgrading Servers in a Windows
NT 4.0 Domain" earlier in this text file. For information about
starting Setup, see Server4.TXT.

   IMPORTANT: When you begin the upgrade of domain controllers running
   Windows NT 4.0, you must upgrade the primary domain
   controller first.

The following table shows the choices that are recommended when
running the Active Directory Installation Wizard on the server that
was formerly the primary domain controller. These recommendations are
for a network of two to five servers (a network within the size of
those discussed in this text file series):

                              controllers running Windows 2000. 
                              For more information, see Help and 
                              Support Center.


During the upgrade, you can choose the location of three
important items: the database containing user accounts and other
Active Directory data, the log file, and the system volume (Sysvol)
folder. The database and the log file can be on any kind of partition
(FAT, FAT32, or NTFS); the database can expand by as much as a factor
of ten from the size it had with Windows NT, so allow plenty of room
for it. (Initially, the log file will take up very little space.) The
system volume folder must be on an NTFS partition. (For information
about NTFS and other file systems, see "Choosing a File System for the
Installation Partition" and "Reformatting or Converting a Partition to
Use NTFS" in Server3.TXT.)


5.4.3  Learning About Active Directory After the First Server
       is Upgraded
-------------------------------------------------------------
As soon as the first server is upgraded, you can open Help and
Support Center and read information about how to use Active Directory.
To open Help and Support Center, click Start, and then click Help and
Support. The following list provides suggestions about information to
review:

   * Additional information about upgrading from a Windows NT 4.0
     domain.

   * "New ways to do familiar tasks," that is, a table that compares
     the way you completed domain tasks with Windows NT with the way
     you complete those tasks with products in the Windows Server
     2003 family.

   * Domains and forests.
  
   * Functional levels (domain functional level and forest functional
     level). After upgrading the last domain controller in a Windows
     NT domain to become a domain controller running Windows Server
     2003, you have the option of changing functional levels, as
     described in the Active Directory topics.

   * The global catalog and also operations master roles, which you do
     not have to take action on as part of the upgrade, but might want
     to learn about.

You can also view the same topics about Active Directory on the
Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/

For information about deployments and upgrades in multiple domains or
in domains larger than five servers, see the Windows Server 2003
Deployment Kit. You can view the Windows Deployment and Resource Kits
on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/


5.4.4  Completing Further Upgrades from Windows NT 4.0
------------------------------------------------------
After you upgrade your primary domain controller and ensure that it
is functioning to your satisfaction, you can begin the upgrade of any
backup domain controllers. (You can upgrade member servers at any
time.)

Upgrade the backup domain controllers one at a time (ensure that each
is backed up before upgrading). Before beginning the upgrade of each
backup domain controller, make sure that at least one domain
controller running Windows Server 2003 is available on the network,
because the user accounts and other Active Directory data will be
copied from the domain controllers that have already been upgraded.
Start and test each server on the network to ensure that it is 
functioning to your satisfaction before upgrading another backup
domain controller.

An upgraded domain controller will appear as a Windows NT 4.0 primary
domain controller to servers and client computers running
Windows NT 4.0. However, it is recommended that you complete the
upgrade of all servers in the domain relatively quickly (rather than
allowing a long delay). This reduces the number of version differences
between computers, simplifying management and troubleshooting, and
also strengthens security.

If you have a remote access server that is a member server, it is
recommended that you upgrade it before the last domain controller is
upgraded. For more information, see "Planning Server Roles and the
Order of Server Upgrades from Windows NT" earlier in this text file.


======================================================================
6.0   DECISIONS TO MAKE FOR A NEW INSTALLATION
======================================================================


This list outlines the basic decisions to make for a
new installation.

What licensing mode to use
--------------------------
With products in the Windows Server 2003 family, you can choose
between two licensing modes:

   * Per Device or Per User

   * Per Server

Per Device or Per User mode requires a separate Client Access License
(CAL) for each device or user that accesses a server running a product
in the Windows Server 2003 family. Per Server mode requires a
separate CAL for each concurrent connection to a server. For more
information about licensing, see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" later in
this text file.

Whether you want to be able to choose between different operating
systems each time you start the computer
-----------------------------------------------------------------
You can set up a computer so that each time you restart it, you can
choose from several different operating systems. For more information,
see "Deciding Whether a Computer Will Contain More Than One Operating
System" in Server3.TXT.

What file system to use on the installation partition
-----------------------------------------------------
You can potentially choose among three file systems for an
installation partition: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is strongly
recommended in most situations. It is the only file system that
supports Active Directory, which includes many important features
such as domains and domain-based security. However, it might be
necessary to have a FAT or FAT32 partition on a basic disk, if you
must set up the computer so that it sometimes runs Windows
Server 2003, Standard Edition, and sometimes runs Windows NT 4.0 or
an earlier operating system. For more information, see "Choosing a
File System for the Installation Partition" in Server3.TXT.

What partition or volume you plan to install the operating system on
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are performing a new installation, review your disk partitions
or volumes before you run Setup (for an upgrade, you will use existing
partitions or volumes). Both partitions and volumes divide a disk into
one or more areas that can be formatted for use by one file system.
Different partitions and volumes often have different drive letters
(for example, C: and D:). After you run Setup, you can make
adjustments to the disk configuration, as long as you do not reformat
or change the partition or volume that contains the operating system.
For information about planning the partitions or volumes for a new
installation, see "Planning Disk Partitions or Volumes for New
Installations" in Server3.TXT.

How to handle IP addresses and TCP/IP name resolution
-----------------------------------------------------
With TCP/IP (the protocol used on the Internet), you need to make
decisions about how to handle IP addressing and name resolution (the
translating of IP addresses into names that users recognize). For more
information, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution"
in Server3.TXT.

Whether to create domains or workgroups for your servers
--------------------------------------------------------
A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies, and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains make it easier for
an administrator to control access to resources and keep track of
users. For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and
Domains" in Server3.TXT.


======================================================================
7.0   CHOOSING A LICENSING MODE
======================================================================


Products in the Windows Server 2003 family support two
licensing modes:

   * Per Device or Per User
 
   * Per Server

If you choose the "Per Device or Per User" mode, each device or user
that accesses a server running a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family requires a separate Client Access License (CAL).
With one CAL, a particular device or user can connect to any number of
servers running products in the Windows Server 2003 family. This
is the most commonly used licensing method for companies with more
than one server running products in the Windows Server 2003
family.

In contrast, Per Server licensing means that each concurrent
connection to this server requires a separate CAL. In other words,
this server can support a fixed number of connections at any one time.
For example, if you select the Per Server client-licensing mode with
five licenses, this server could have five concurrent connections at
any one time (if each client requires one connection, this is five
clients at any one time). The clients using the connections do not
need any additional licenses.

The Per Server licensing mode is often preferred by small companies
with only one server. It is also useful for Internet or remote access
servers where the client computers might not be licensed as network
clients for products in the Windows Server 2003 family. You can
specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject
any additional logon requests.

If you are unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server, because you
can change once from Per Server mode to Per Device or Per User mode at
no cost. After you choose Per Server and complete Setup, you can
display topics about licensing modes in Help and Support Center (click
Start, and then click Help and Support). If you use Terminal Server,
be sure to look for topics about Terminal Server Licensing.
