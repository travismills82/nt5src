======================================================================
1.0   UPGRADES COMPARED TO NEW INSTALLATIONS
======================================================================


This section compares upgrading to performing a new installation.
Upgrading is replacing Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server with
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. Installing, in contrast
with upgrading, means completely removing the previous operating
system, or installing a product in the Windows Server 2003 family
on a disk or disk partition with no previous operating system.

The following lists describe items to consider when deciding between
an upgrade and a new installation:

Points to consider for an upgrade:
----------------------------------

   * With an upgrade, configuration is simpler, and your existing
     users, settings, groups, rights, and permissions are retained.

   * With an upgrade, you do not need to re-install files and
     applications. As with any major changes to the hard disk,
     however, it is recommended that you back up the disk before
     beginning an upgrade.

   * If you want to upgrade and then use the same applications as
     before, be sure to review applications information in
     Relnotes.htm (in the \Docs folder on the Setup CD). Also, for the
     most recent information on compatible applications for products
     in the Windows Server 2003 family, see the software
     compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

Points to consider for a new installation:
------------------------------------------
   * If you reformat your hard disk and then perform a new
     installation, the efficiency of your disk might improve
     (compared to not reformatting it). Reformatting also gives you
     the opportunity to modify the size or number of disk
     partitions, to make them match your requirements more closely.

   * If you want to practice careful configuration management, for
     example, for a server where high availability is important,
     you might want to perform a new installation on that server
     instead of an upgrade. This is especially true on servers on
     which the operating system has been upgraded several times in
     the past.


------------------
1.1   Upgrade Path
------------------
If you upgrade, Setup automatically installs Windows
Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, into the same folder as the currently
installed copy of Windows 2000 Datacenter Server. The only operating
system from which you can upgrade to Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, is Windows 2000 Datacenter Server.


======================================================================
2.0   SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY
======================================================================
Before upgrading or installing your server, make sure that you have
chosen hardware that supports Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition.


-------------------------
2.1   System Requirements
-------------------------
Computers that run Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, must
be on the compatibility list for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter
Edition. For details, see the hardware compatibility information in
the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

The requirements for systems on the compatibility list for
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, include the following:

   * For an x86-based computer:

      * Eight or more processors with a minimum speed of 550
        megahertz (MHz). For computers on which you are upgrading
        from Windows 2000 Datacenter Server, the minimum processor
        speed is 400 MHz. A maximum of 32 processors per computer
        is supported.

      * 512 megabytes (MB) of RAM minimum, 64 gigabytes (GB) maximum.

   * For an Itanium architecture-based computer:

      * Eight or more processors with a minimum speed of 733 MHz. A
        maximum of 64 processors per computer is supported.

      * 1 GB of RAM minimum, 512 GB maximum.

   * A hard disk partition or volume with enough free space to
     accommodate the setup process. To ensure that you have
     flexibility in your later use of the operating system, it is
     recommended that you allow considerably more space than the
     minimum required for running Setup, which is approximately
     2 GB to 4 GB on an x86-based computer and 3 GB to 4 GB on an
     Itanium architecture-based computer. The larger amount of space
     is required if you are running Setup across a network instead
     of from a CD-ROM.

        Note: The setup process requires the free disk space described
        in the previous paragraph. After Setup is finished, actual
        hard disk space used for the operating system will be more
        than the free space required for Setup, because of space
        needed for the paging file, for any optional components you
        install, and (on domain controllers) for user accounts and
        other Active Directory information. The usual size for the
        paging file is 1.5 times the size of the RAM. For information
        about the paging file, optional components, user accounts, and
        information stored in Active Directory, see Help and Support
        Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing
        Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support.

   * VGA or higher-resolution monitor (Super VGA 800x600 or higher
     recommended), keyboard, and (optionally) a mouse or other
     pointing device.

     As an alternative, for operation without a monitor or keyboard,
     you can choose a remote diagnostic and support processor that
     is designed for products in the Windows Server 2003
     family. For details, see the hardware compatibility information
     in the Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

For CD-ROM installation:

   * A CD-ROM or DVD drive.

For network installation:

   * One or more network adapters and related cables that are
     designed for products in the Windows Server 2003 family.
     For details, see the hardware compatibility information in the
     Windows Catalog at:

        http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/

   * A server from which to offer network access for the Setup files.


----------------------------
2.2   Hardware Compatibility
----------------------------
When you purchase a server running Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, you are purchasing a system that has been
extensively tested for compatibility between the hardware components,
the drivers, and the operating system. For more information about
hardware compatibility, contact your hardware manufacturer, and see
the hardware compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


2.2.1  Using Dynamic Update for Updated Drivers and Other Setup Files
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a working Internet connection on the computer on which
you run Setup, you can choose Dynamic Update during Setup and obtain
the most up-to-date Setup files, including drivers and other files.
Whenever an important update is made to any crucial Setup file, that
update is made available through Dynamic Update functionality built
into the Windows Update Web site. Some of the updated files will be
replacements (for example, an updated driver or updated Setup file)
and some will be additions (for example, a driver not available at the
time that the Setup CD was created). It is recommended that you use
Dynamic Update when running Setup.

Dynamic Update has been carefully designed so that it is reliable and
easy to use:

   * The files on the Dynamic Update section of the Windows Update
     Web site have been carefully tested and selected. Only files
     that are important in ensuring that Setup runs well are made
     available through Dynamic Update. Files with minor updates that
     will not significantly affect Setup are not part of Dynamic
     Update.

   * Because Dynamic Update downloads only the files that are
     required for your computer, the Dynamic Update software briefly
     examines your computer hardware. No personal information is
     collected, and no information is saved. The only purpose is
     to select appropriate drivers for your hardware configuration.
     This keeps the download as short as possible and ensures that
     only necessary drivers are downloaded to your hard disk.

   * You can use Dynamic Update when running a preinstallation
     compatibility check from the product CD, or when running Setup
     itself. Either way, you obtain the most up-to-date files for
     running Setup.

   * You can use Dynamic Update with unattended Setup. Preparing for
     this requires several steps. For a brief description of
     unattended Setup, see "Planning for Unattended Setup"
     in Datactr2.TXT. For details about how to use Dynamic Update
     with unattended Setup (also called automated installation),
     see "Automating and Customizing Installations" in the
     Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit. You can view the
     Windows Deployment and Resource Kits on the Web at:
      
        http://www.microsoft.com/reskit/

The Windows Update Web site offers a variety of updates that you can
use after completing Setup. To learn more, go to:

   http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/


======================================================================
3.0   IMPORTANT FILES TO REVIEW
======================================================================


At some point in your planning process, before you run Setup,
familiarize yourself with the Relnotes.htm file found in the \Docs
folder on the CD for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition.

This file contains important usage information about topics such as
application compatibility, hardware, or networking. Also familiarize
yourself with information about hardware compatibility for products in
the Windows Server 2003 family.

For the most recent information on compatible applications for
products in the Windows Server 2003 family, see the software
compatibility information in the Windows Catalog at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/


======================================================================
4.0   Decisions to Make for a New Installation
======================================================================


This list outlines the basic decisions to make for a
new installation.

   Note: On an Itanium architecture-based computer, you can install
   Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, the 64-bit version of Windows
   Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, or the 64-bit version of
   Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. In the sections that
   follow, information about operating systems that you cannot install
   does not apply. For example, information about Windows 2000 or
   Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 does not apply to an Itanium
   architecture-based computer.

What licensing mode to use
--------------------------
With products in the Windows Server 2003 family, you can choose
between two licensing modes:

   * Per Device or Per User
   * Per Server

Per Device or Per User mode requires a separate Client Access
License (CAL) for each device or user that accesses a server
running a product in the Windows Server 2003 family. Per
Server mode requires a separate CAL for each concurrent
connection to a server. For more information about licensing,
see "Choosing a Licensing Mode" later in this text file.


What file system to use on the installation partition
-----------------------------------------------------
You can potentially choose among three file systems for an
installation partition: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is strongly
recommended in most situations. It is the only file system that
supports Active Directory, which includes many important features
such as domains and domain-based security.


What partition or volume you plan to install the operating system on
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are performing a new installation, review your disk partitions
or volumes before you run Setup (for an upgrade, you will use existing
partitions or volumes). Both partitions and volumes divide a disk into
one or more areas that can be formatted for use by one file system.
Different partitions and volumes often have different drive letters
(for example, C: and D:). After you run Setup, you can make
adjustments to the disk configuration, as long as you do not reformat
or change the partition or volume that contains the operating system.
For information about planning the partitions or volumes for a new
installation, see "Planning Disk Partitions or Volumes for New
Installations" later in this text file.


How to handle IP addresses and TCP/IP name resolution
-----------------------------------------------------
With TCP/IP (the protocol used on the Internet), you need to make
decisions about how to handle IP addressing and name resolution (the
translating of IP addresses into names that users recognize). For more
information, see "Networks: TCP/IP, IP Addresses, and Name Resolution"
later in this text file.


Whether to create domains or workgroups for your servers
--------------------------------------------------------
A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies, and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains make it easier for an
administrator to control access to resources and keep track of users.
For more information, see "Deciding Between Workgroups and Domains"
later in this text file.


======================================================================
5.0   CHOOSING A LICENSING MODE
======================================================================


Products in the Windows Server 2003 family support two licensing
modes:

  * Per Device or Per User
  * Per Server

If you choose the "Per Device or Per User" mode, each device or user
that accesses a server running a product in the Windows
Server 2003 family requires a separate Client Access License (CAL).
With one CAL, a particular device or user can connect to any number of
servers running products in the Windows Server 2003 family. This
is the most commonly used licensing method for companies with more
than one server running products in the Windows Server 2003
family.

In contrast, Per Server licensing means that each concurrent
connection to this server requires a separate CAL. In other words,
this server can support a fixed number of connections at any one time.
For example, if you select the Per Server client-licensing mode with
five licenses, this server could have five concurrent connections at
any one time (if each client requires one connection, this is five
clients at any one time). The clients using the connections do not
need any additional licenses.

The Per Server licensing mode is often preferred by small companies
with only one server. It is also useful for Internet or remote access
servers where the client computers might not be licensed as network
clients for products in the Windows Server 2003 family. You can
specify a maximum number of concurrent server connections and reject
any additional logon requests.

If you are unsure which mode to use, choose Per Server, because you
can change once from Per Server mode to Per Device or Per User mode at
no cost. After you choose Per Server and complete Setup, you can
display topics about licensing modes in Help and Support Center (click
Start, and then click Help and Support). If you use Terminal Server,
be sure to look for topics about Terminal Server Licensing.


======================================================================
6.0   CHOOSING A FILE SYSTEM FOR THE INSTALLATION PARTITION
======================================================================


You can choose among three file systems for an
installation partition: NTFS, FAT, and FAT32. NTFS is strongly
recommended in most situations.

   Note: You can use important features such as Active Directory
   and domain-based security only by choosing NTFS as your
   file system.

   IMPORTANT: On GPT disks, which are available only on Itanium
   architecture-based computers, it is strongly recommended that you
   use NTFS for the installation partition. However, if you have an
   Itanium architecture-based computer and you see that it has a small
   FAT partition of 100 MB or more, do not delete or reformat this
   partition. The partition is required for the loading of the
   operating system. For more information, see "Starting Setup on an
   Itanium Architecture-based Computer" in Datactr2.TXT.

The sections that follow provide information about reformatting or
converting a FAT or FAT32 partition to use NTFS, as well as additional
background information about NTFS, FAT, and FAT32.


--------------------------------------------------------
6.1   Reformatting or Converting a Partition to Use NTFS
--------------------------------------------------------
If you have a FAT or FAT32 partition on which you want to install a
product in the Windows Server 2003 family, and you want to use
NTFS instead, you have two choices:

   * You can convert the FAT or FAT32 partition to NTFS. This leaves
     files intact, although the partition may have somewhat more
     fragmentation and slower performance than a partition formatted
     with NTFS. However, it is still advantageous to use NTFS,
     regardless of whether the partition was formatted with NTFS
     or converted.

     If you install a product in the Windows Server 2003 family
     on a FAT or FAT32 partition, you are offered the option to
     convert the partition to NTFS. You can also convert a FAT or
     FAT32 partition after Setup by using Convert.exe. For more
     information about Convert.exe, after completing Setup, click
     Start, click Run, type cmd and then press ENTER. In the command
     window, type help convert, and then press ENTER.

   * You can reformat the partition with NTFS. This erases all files
     on the partition, but results in less fragmentation and better
     performance than with a converted partition.

        IMPORTANT: If you have an Itanium architecture-based computer
        and you see that it has a small FAT partition of 100 MB or
        more, do not delete or reformat this partition. The partition
        is required for the loading of the operating system. For more
        information, see "Starting Setup on an Itanium
        Architecture-based Computer" in Datactr2.TXT.

If you format a partition during Setup, the file systems choices are
listed as NTFS and FAT. The following table provides information about
the relationship between partition size and file system choices during
Setup.

======================================================================

created with Microsoft Windows   for a product in the Windows
95, Windows 98, or Windows       Server 2003 family, would have to
Millennium Edition.)             use NTFS. In other words, the
                                 Windows Server 2003 family
                                 continues to support
                                 previously-formatted FAT32 partitions
                                 of this size.


If you format a partition during Setup, you can choose between a quick
format and a full format:

Quick format
Quick format creates the file system structure on the disk without
verifying the integrity of every sector. Choose this method for any
disk that has no bad sectors and no history of file-corruption
problems that might be related to bad sectors.

Full format
A full format identifies and tracks bad sectors so that they are not
used for storing data. Choose this method for any disk that has bad
sectors or has a history of file-corruption problems that might be
related to bad sectors.


------------------------------------
6.2   NTFS Compared to FAT and FAT32
------------------------------------
NTFS has always been a more powerful file system than FAT and FAT32.
Windows 2000, Windows XP, and the Windows Server 2003 family
include a new version of NTFS, with support for a variety of features
including Active Directory, which is needed for domains, user
accounts, and other important security features. For more details
about features in NTFS, see "NTFS" later in this text file.

FAT and FAT32 are similar to each other, except that FAT32 is
designed for larger disks than FAT. The file system that works most
easily with large disks is NTFS.

The following table compares disk and file sizes possible with each
file system.


======================================================================

   Note: On Itanium architecture-based computers with multiple disks,
   your choices include not only file systems but also partition
   style. For more information about the two partition styles
   available on Itanium architecture-based computers, see "Planning
   Disk Partitions or Volumes for New Installations" later in this
   text file, as well as Help and Support Center, and the Microsoft
   Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit, "Server Management Guide."


----------
6.3   NTFS
----------
This section provides background information about the features
available with NTFS. Some of these features include:

   * Better scalability to large drives. The maximum partition or
     volume size for NTFS is much greater than that for FAT, and
     as volume or partition sizes increase, performance with NTFS
     does not degrade as it does with FAT.

   * Active Directory (and domains, which are part of Active
     Directory). With Active Directory, you can view and control
     network resources easily. With domains, you can fine-tune
     security options while keeping administration simple. Domain
     controllers and Active Directory require NTFS.

   * Compression features, including the ability to compress or
     uncompress a drive, a folder, or a specific file. (However,
     a file cannot be both compressed and encrypted at the same
     time.)

   * File encryption, which greatly enhances security. (However, a
     file cannot be both compressed and encrypted at the same time.)

   * Permissions that can be set on individual files rather than just
     folders.

   * Remote Storage, which provides an extension to your disk space
     by making removable media such as tapes more accessible. (This
     feature is not included with Windows Server 2003, Web
     Edition, or with Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition.)

   * Recovery logging of disk activities, which allows NTFS to
     restore information quickly in the event of power failure or
     other system problems.

   * Sparse files. These are very large files created by applications
     in such a way that only limited disk space is needed. That is,
     NTFS allocates disk space only to the portions of a file that
     are written to.

   * Disk quotas, which you can use to monitor and control the amount
     of disk space used by individual users.

This is only a partial list of the features in NTFS in the
Windows Server 2003 family.

For information about converting or reformatting a FAT or FAT32
partition, see "Reformatting or Converting a Partition to Use NTFS"
earlier in this text file.


======================================================================
7.0   PLANNING DISK PARTITIONS OR VOLUMES FOR NEW INSTALLATIONS
======================================================================


You must plan your disk partitions before you run Setup only if both
of the following conditions are true:

  * You are performing a new installation, not an upgrade.

  * The disk on which you are installing is a basic disk, not a
    dynamic disk. Basic disks are the disk type that existed before
    Windows 2000; most disks are basic disks. Dynamic disks are
    disks that once were basic but were changed to dynamic using
    Windows 2000, Windows XP, or a product in the Windows
    Server 2003 family. If you plan to install to a dynamic disk,
    you cannot change the volume or partition sizes on the disk
    during Setup, and therefore no planning is needed regarding
    partition sizes. Instead, review the guidelines in "Working
    with Dynamic Disks and Setup" later in this text file.

Disk partitioning is a way of dividing your physical disk so that
each section functions as a separate unit. When you create partitions
on a basic disk, you divide the disk into one or more areas that can
be formatted for use by a file system, such as FAT or NTFS. Different
partitions often have different drive letters (for example, C: and
D:). A basic disk can have up to four primary partitions, or three
primary partitions and one extended partition. (An extended partition
can be subdivided into logical drives, while a primary partition
cannot be subdivided.)

   IMPORTANT: If you plan to delete or create partitions on a hard
   disk, be sure to back up the disk contents beforehand, because
   these actions will destroy any existing data. As with any major
   change to disk contents, it is recommended that you back up the
   entire contents of the hard disk before working with partitions,
   even if you plan to leave one or more of your partitions alone.

Before you run Setup to perform a new installation, determine the
size of the partition on which to install. There is no set formula for
figuring a partition size. The basic principle is to allow plenty of
room for the operating system, applications, and other files that you
plan to put on the installation partition. The files for setting up
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, require approximately 2
GB to 4 GB on an x86-based computer and 3 GB to 4 GB on an Itanium
architecture-based computer, as described in "System Requirements"
earlier in this text file. It is recommended that you allow
considerably more disk space than the minimum amount. It is not
unreasonable to allow 4 GB to 10 GB on the partition, or more for
large installations. This allows space for a variety of items,
including optional components, user accounts, Active Directory
information, logs, future service packs, the paging file used by the
operating system, and other items.

When you perform a new installation, you can specify the partition on
which to install. If you specify a partition on which another
operating system exists, you will be prompted to confirm your choice.

During Setup, create and size only the partition on which you want to
install Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition. After
installation is complete, you can use Disk Management to manage new
and existing disks and volumes. This includes creating new partitions
from unpartitioned space; deleting, renaming, and reformatting
existing partitions; adding and removing hard disks; and changing a
basic disk to the dynamic disk storage type, or dynamic to basic.

On Itanium architecture-based computers with more than one disk, you
can plan not only the sizes of partitions, but also the partition
style for each disk. A partition style determines the way that
information about the partition is stored. There are two partition
styles. The newer style (used on Itanium architecture-based computers
only) stores partition information in the
globally unique identifier (GUID) partition table (GPT). The older
style stores information in the master boot record (MBR). On Itanium
architecture-based computers, you must install
Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, on a GPT disk. With GPT,
you can create more partitions and larger volumes, and take advantage
of other benefits. For more information about partition styles on
Itanium architecture-based computers, see Help and Support Center,
and the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit, "Server Management
Guide."


------------------------------------------------------------------
7.1   Disk Partition Requirements for Remote Installation Services
------------------------------------------------------------------
If you plan to use Remote Installation Services on this server so
that you can install operating systems onto other computers, a
separate partition for use by Remote Installation Services is
necessary. Plan on using NTFS on this partition: NTFS is required for
the Single Instance Store feature of Remote Installation Services.

If you need to create a new partition for Remote Installation
Services, plan on doing it after Setup, and leave enough unpartitioned
disk space so that you can create it (at least 4 GB of space is
recommended). As an alternative, for the system disk (not cluster
disks), you can plan to make the disk a dynamic disk, which allows
more flexibility in the use of the disk space than a basic disk.

For more information about Remote Installation Services and about
disk and partition choices, see Help and Support Center. To open Help
and Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
click Help and Support.


--------------------------------------
7.2   Options When Partitioning a Disk
--------------------------------------
You can change the partitions on your disk during Setup only if you
are performing a new installation, not an upgrade. You can modify the
partitioning of the disk after Setup by using Disk Management.

If you are performing a new installation, Setup examines the hard
disk to determine its existing configuration, and then offers the
following options:

   * If the hard disk is unpartitioned, you can create and size the
     partition on which you will install a product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family.

   * If the hard disk is partitioned but has enough unpartitioned
     disk space, you can create the partition for your Windows
     Server 2003 family product by using the unpartitioned space.

   * If the hard disk has an existing partition that is large enough,
     you can install a product in the Windows Server 2003
     family on that partition, with or without reformatting the
     partition first. Reformatting a partition erases all data on
     the partition. If you do not reformat the partition, but you
     do install a Windows Server 2003 family product where
     there is already an operating system, that operating system
     will be overwritten, and you must reinstall any applications
     you want to use with the Windows Server 2003
     family product.

   * If the hard disk has an existing partition, you can delete it to
     create more unpartitioned disk space for a partition for a
     Windows Server 2003 family product. Deleting an existing
     partition also erases any data on that partition.


--------------------------------------------------------------
7.3   Computers that Contain Multiple Windows Server 2003
      Family Partitions
--------------------------------------------------------------
You can set up a computer so that each time you restart it, you can
choose from different installations of products in the Windows
Server 2003 family. If you want to set up a computer this way, note
the following:

   * It is not necessary to maintain multiple operating systems as a
     safeguard against problems with starting the computer. With
     products in the Windows Server 2003 family, you have other
     options for system recovery. For example, if you have a problem
     with a newly installed device driver, you can use Safe Mode,
     in which Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, restarts
     with default settings and the minimum number of drivers. For
     more information about Safe Mode and other options for system
     recovery, see Help and Support Center.

   * Install each operating system on a different partition, and
     install the applications used with an operating system on the
     same partition with it. If an application is used with two
     different operating systems, install it on two partitions.

   * If the computer participates in a domain, use a different
     computer name for each installation. Because a unique security
     identifier (SID) is used for each installation on a domain,
     the computer name for each installation must be unique, even
     for multiple installations on the same computer.

   * If you use the Encrypting File System (EFS) on a computer
     containing multiple installations of products in the
     Windows Server 2003 family, the encrypted files will not be
     readable between the different installations unless you take
     one of the following approaches. One approach is to ensure that
     all the installations are in the same domain and that the user
     of these installations has a roaming profile. Another approach
     is to export the user's file encryption certificate and
     associated private key from one installation and import it into
     the other installations. For more information about EFS,
     roaming user profiles, and importing and exporting
     certificates, see Help and Support Center. To open Help and
     Support Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then
     click Help and Support.


------------------------------------------
7.4   Working with Dynamic Disks and Setup
------------------------------------------
A dynamic disk is a disk using the new storage type introduced with
Windows 2000. If you changed a disk to dynamic and you want to perform
a new installation on the disk, review the following.

   * If you used Windows 2000 or Windows XP to change a disk with no
     partitions directly to a dynamic disk, you must revert the disk
     to basic before you can install an operating system on it.

        CAUTION: All data will be lost in the process of reverting the
        disk to basic, so back it up first.

     You can use Windows 2000 or Windows XP to revert the disk, or you
     can use the Setup program for a product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family. To use Windows 2000 or
     Windows XP, follow the instructions in Help for your operating
     system. To use Setup for a product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family, during the partitioning phase,
     find the dynamic disk among the list of available partitions and
     then delete it (which erases all data on all volumes). You will
     be prompted to confirm your action. After you do this, the disk
     will contain only unpartitioned space, and you can use Setup to
     create a new (basic disk) partition on it.

   * If you plan to rerun Setup on a computer on which a product in
     the Windows Server 2003 family was already installed, and
     the computer contains dynamic disks, be sure to read about the
     limitations for installing operating systems on disks that are
     changed to dynamic using a product in the
     Windows Server 2003 family. For more information, see topics
     about dynamic disks and the partition table in Help and Support
     Center. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup,
     click Start, and then click Help and Support.


======================================================================
8.0   NETWORKS: TCP/IP, IP ADDRESSES, AND NAME RESOLUTION
======================================================================


TCP/IP is the network protocol that provides Internet access. It is
the protocol used by most servers, although you can use additional or
different network adapters and their associated protocols on
your servers.

To use TCP/IP, make sure that each server is provided with an IP
address, either a dynamic or automatic address provided through
software, or a static address that you obtain and set. Because these
addresses are numbers and therefore hard to remember, you will also
have to provide users with names that are easier to use. Mapping this
type of name to an IP address is called name resolution, and can be
accomplished by various methods, primarily the Domain Name System
(DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The following sections
provide more information.

For detailed information about TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS, and WINS, see Help
and Support Center as well as the Windows Server 2003 Resource
Kit. To open Help and Support Center, after completing Setup, click
Start, and then click Help and Support.

You can also view Help and Support Center topics on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/


------------------
8.1   IP Addresses
------------------
As outlined in the preceding section, using TCP/IP requires that an
IP address be provided for each computer. This section describes IP
addressing options. There are two basic approaches for providing an IP
address for a server you are installing:


Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
------------------------------------------
You can provide IP addresses to the computers on your network by
configuring one or more DHCP servers, which provide IP addresses
dynamically to other computers. A DHCP server must itself be assigned
a static IP address.

One server or several servers can provide DHCP along with one or more
name resolution services, which are called Domain Name System (DNS)
and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). The name resolution services
are described in the next section, "Name Resolution for TCP/IP."

If you want to run Setup before you have finalized your decisions
about which server to use as your DHCP server and what static IP
address to assign to that server, you can choose "Typical settings" in
the Networking Settings dialog box during Setup and complete the
network configuration later. If you do this and there is no DHCP
server in the network, Setup will use a limited IP addressing option
called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). During the time that a
server is using APIPA, it can communicate only with other computers
using APIPA on the same network segment. A server that is using APIPA
cannot make connections to the Internet (for browsing or e-mail), and
cannot be used with DNS or Active Directory (which depends on DNS).

If you know which server you want to use as your DHCP server, when
installing that server, in the Networking Settings dialog box in
Setup, choose "Custom settings," and specify a static IP address and
related network settings. For more information about how to do this,
see "Specifying Networking Settings" in Datactr2.TXT. After Setup, use
information in Help and Support Center (click Start and then click
Help and Support) to install the DHCP component and complete the
configuration of the DHCP server.


Static IP addressing
--------------------
For certain types of servers, you must assign a static IP address and
subnet mask during or after Setup. These servers include DHCP servers,
DNS servers, WINS servers, and any server providing access to users on
the Internet. It is also recommended that you assign a static IP
address and subnet mask for each domain controller. If a computer has
more than one network adapter, you must assign a separate IP address
for each adapter.

If you want to run Setup on a server before you have finalized your
decision about the static IP address you want to assign to that
server, you can choose "Typical settings" in the Networking Settings
dialog box during Setup and configure that server later. In this
situation, if there is a DHCP server in the network, Setup will obtain
an IP address configuration from DHCP. If there is no DHCP server in
the network, Setup will use Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA).
APIPA is described in the previous item in this list, "Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP)."

For more information about static IP addresses, including private IP
addresses (which you choose from certain ranges of addresses) and
public IP addresses (which you obtain from an Internet service
provider), see Help and Support Center. To open Help and Support
Center, after completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help
and Support.

After you have formed a plan for IP addressing, the next components
to consider are those for name resolution, which is the process of
mapping a computer name (something that users can recognize and
remember) to the appropriate IP address. The following sections
describe options for name resolution.


--------------------------------
8.2   Name Resolution for TCP/IP
--------------------------------
Name resolution is a process that provides users with
easy-to-remember server names, instead of requiring them to use the
numerical IP addresses by which servers identify themselves on the
TCP/IP network. The name-resolution services are Domain Name System
(DNS) and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS).


DNS
---
DNS is a hierarchical naming system used for locating computers on
the Internet and private TCP/IP networks. One or more DNS servers are
needed in most installations. DNS is required for Internet e-mail, Web
browsing, and Active Directory. DNS is often used as a name resolution
service in domains with clients running Windows 2000, Windows XP, or
products in the Windows Server 2003 family.

DNS is installed automatically when you create a domain controller
(or when you install Active Directory on an existing member server,
which makes it a domain controller), unless the software
for Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition, detects that a DNS
server already exists for that domain. You can also install DNS by
using Add/Remove Windows Components, which is part of Add or Remove
Programs in Control Panel.

If you plan to install DNS on a server, specify a static IP address
on that server and configure that server to use that IP address for
its own name resolution.


WINS
----
If you provide support for clients running Windows NT or any
earlier Microsoft operating system, you might need to install Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) on one or more servers in the domain. You
might also need to install WINS if it is required by your
applications. You can install WINS after Setup by using Add/Remove
Windows Components, which is part of Add or Remove Programs in Control
Panel.

If you plan to install WINS on a server, specify a static IP address
on that server.


======================================================================
9.0   DECIDING BETWEEN WORKGROUPS AND DOMAINS
======================================================================


A domain is a group of accounts and network resources that share a
common directory database and set of security policies, and might have
security relationships with other domains. A workgroup is a more basic
grouping, intended only to help users find objects such as printers
and shared folders within that group. Domains are the recommended
choice for all networks except very small ones with few users.

In a workgroup, users might have to remember multiple passwords, one
for each network resource. (In addition, different users can use
different passwords for each resource.) In a domain, passwords and
permissions are simpler to keep track of, because a domain has a
single, centralized database of user accounts, permissions, and other
network details. The information in this database is replicated
automatically among domain controllers. You determine which servers
are domain controllers and which are simply members of the domain. You
can determine these roles not only during Setup but afterward.

Domains, and the Active Directory directory system of which they are
a part, provide many options for making resources easily available to
users while maintaining good monitoring and security. For more
information about Active Directory, see Help and Support Center (after
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support).

You can also view Help and Support Center topics on the Web at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/proddoc/


--------------------------------------------------------
9.1   Planning for Domain Controllers and Member Servers
--------------------------------------------------------
With Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows
Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; or Windows Server 2003,
Datacenter Edition, servers in a domain can have one of two roles:
domain controllers, which contain matching copies of the user accounts
and other Active Directory data in a given domain, and member servers,
which belong to a domain but do not contain a copy of the Active
Directory data. (A server that belongs to a workgroup, not a domain,
is called a stand-alone server.) It is possible to change the role of
a server back and forth from domain controller to member server
(or stand-alone server), even after Setup is complete. However, it is
recommended that you plan your domain before running Setup and change
server roles (and server names) only when necessary.

For more information about domain controllers and other
Active Directory topics, see Help and Support Center (after
completing Setup, click Start, and then click Help and Support).
