This binary is instrumented for building a testaudit binary.  To remove
this, delete audit.h, testaudit.h, and testaudit.cpp.  Then remove any
includes of "testaudit.h" and any macros containing CHECKPOINT.

For information about testaudit, see \\georgema11\testaudit.

Note that the binary will not contain any testaudit features unless a
special build is made.  The normal build process will produce a normal
binary from these files as they are.
