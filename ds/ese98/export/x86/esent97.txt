
ESENT97.DLL is a renamed version of the ESENT.DLL that shipped
with W2k SP2 (build 6.0.3940.13). The binary is based off the
binary dropped by Exchange, BEFORE it gets massaged by the NT
build process. Here are the steps to produce ESENT97.DLL:

- Copy ESENT.DLL and ESENT.PDB directly from \\exrel\release
  (or wherever Exchange dropped the binaries).

- Rename ESENT.DLL and ESENT.PDB to ESENT97.DLL and ESENT97.PDB,
  respectively.

- Run "splitsym -a ESENT97.DLL" to extract all debug info from
  ESENT97.DLL and place it into a new file named ESENT97.DBG.

- ESENT97.DBG will contain a hard-coded reference to ESENT.PDB.
  To add a reference to ESENT97.PDB, run "symset ESENT97.PDB".
  If you subsequently pull up ESENT97.DBG in a file viewer
  (eg. list.exe), you'll see that a reference to ESENT97.PDB
  was appended, albeit with a hard-coded path to the current
  location of ESENT97.PDB. Don't worry about the hard-coded
  path. The debugger seems to strip off path information when
  searching for the symbol file.

- When attempting to load symbols for ESENT97.DLL in the
  debugger, the debugger will complain about a signature and/or
  timestamp mismatch, so you will have to load the symbols
  manually and force the debugger to ignore the mismatch. To
  do this, run "!reload /f /i esent97.dll" in the debugger.
