The IIS 4.0 and IIS 5.0 Web site and FTP site cluster resources are not compatible with IIS 6.0 and will be disabled during the upgrade. Prior to upgrading to IIS 6.0, you should review the "Upgrading on Cluster Nodes" chapter in the Getting Started manual that came with your Microsoft® Windows® Server 2003 operating system. You can also access the Getting Started Guide text files in the \Docs folder on your Windows Server 2003 operating system installation CD. After upgrading to IIS 6.0, you will then need to migrate your Web site and FTP site cluster resources.
