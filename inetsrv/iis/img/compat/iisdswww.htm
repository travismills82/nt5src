<h3>IIS World Wide Web Publishing Service (WWW service) Is Disabled During Upgrade</h3>

<P>To protect your server from attacks by malicious users, the World Wide Web Publishing Service (WWW service) will be disabled during upgrade. Microsoft&reg;&nbsp;Windows&reg;&nbsp;2000&nbsp;Server installs Internet Information Services (IIS) by default, and requires administrators to secure IIS to prevent attacks.</P>

<P>The IIS Lockdown Tool has not been run on this Windows 2000 server. If you do not want to allow the WWW service to be disabled, you must download and run the IIS Lockdown Tool, or add the override registry key. Otherwise, you can continue with the upgrade and re-enable the WWW service after the upgrade has completed.</P>

<P><B>Important:</B> If you use the World Wide Web Publishing Service (WWW service), we strongly recommend that you run the IIS Lockdown Tool before upgrading to a product in the Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2003 family. The IIS Lockdown Tool will help secure your computer by disabling or removing unnecessary features that are present in your Windows 2000 Server installation. These features would otherwise have remained on your machine after upgrading, leaving your server vulnerable to attacks. Using the IIS Lockdown Tool instead of using the override registry key or re-enabling the WWW service after installation allows you to fine-tune the level of security to your particular needs.</P>

<P><B>When upgrading to a member of the Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2003 family, the WWW service will NOT be disabled if any of the following conditions are present:</B></P>
<UL>
<LI>You have already run the IIS Lockdown Tool on your Windows&nbsp;2000&nbsp;Server before starting the upgrade process. The IIS Lockdown Tool reduces surface attack by disabling unnecessary features, and it allows you to decide which features to enable for your site. The IIS Lockdown Tool is available at IIS Lockdown Tool (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=8599). </LI>
<LI>The registry key <B>RetainW3SVCStatus</B> has been added to the registry under <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC</B>. Under <B>RetainW3SVCStatus</B> you can add any value and then assign a DWORD value to it. For example, you can create the key <B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\RetainW3SVCStatus\do_not_disable</B> with the DWORD value of 1. </LI>
<LI>In the unattended install case, an entry &quot;<i><B>DisableWebServiceOnUpgrade</B></i> = false&quot;  exists in the unattended install script. </LI>
</UL>

<P>After the upgrade is completed, you can enable the WWW service using either IIS Manager or the Services snap-in.</P>
