NOTE: This only works if all data files are in same place.
- Copy Migration package to <systemdrive>\inetpub\uddi\bin
    - found in builds at <build>\raw\uddi.microsoft.com\migration
- Copy BootStrap package to <systemdrive\inetpub\uddi\bootstrap
    - found in builds at <build>\raw\uddi.microsoft.com\bootstrap
- Restore the Live Site backup to a database named uddi_v15 on your DB Server.
    - for instrunction on this, see SQL Help
- run <systemdrive>\inetpub\uddi\bin\runmigrate.cmd [bootpath] [datapath] /p
    bootpath = <systemdrive>\inetpub\uddi\bootstrap
    datapath = <systemdrive>\inetpub\uddi\data
- follow steps as promted
- Backup the following:
    - <systemdrive>\inetpub\uddi\bin\migrate.log.txt
    - <systemdrive>\inetpub\uddi\bin\migrate.exceptions.txt
    - <systemdrive>\inetpub\uddi\bin\exceptions\*.xml
- If this is the Real Live site replication, send notifications to all users in
        migrate.log.txt The email should include attachments which show the old
        and new version of changed publications in the \exceptions directory.
        An email generation tool built for the v1.0 to V1.5 migration may be
        adapted for this purpose.  Instructions for this process are not
        included in this document.
