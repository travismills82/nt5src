			<h2>UDDI Business Registry Beta Test</h2>
			<p class='content'>
				The UDDI Business Registry is currently undergoing beta testing. During
				beta test, operators of the UDDI Business Registry will continue to test
				the functionality of the service while providing IT architects and system
				administrators the opportunity to learn how to use UDDI. 
			</P>

			<p class='content'>
				During the beta test, operators will make every effort to preserve registry contents,
				however we cannot guarantee the permanence of the data entered or whether
				some modifications will be necessary as we move to the final version 2
				service. In these instances, the operator hosting the data will make every
				effort to notify owners of affected data.
			</P>

			<p class='content'>
				Microsoft has also launched a UDDI test site for software developers at 
				<a href='http://test.uddi.microsoft.com' target='_new'>http://test.uddi.microsoft.com</a>.
				This site provides developers with the opportunity to test programs designed to
				interact with the UDDI Business Registry without running the risk of creating a
				formal business registration for your company. 
			</P>
