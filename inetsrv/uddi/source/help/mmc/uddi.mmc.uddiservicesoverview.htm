		<h2>What is UDDI?</h2>
		<p>
			Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) is an industry 
			specification for publishing and locating information about Web services. It 
			defines an information framework that enables you to describe and classify your 
			organization, its services, and the technical details about the interfaces of 
			the Web services you expose. The framework also enables you to consistently 
			discover services, or interfaces of a particular type, classification, or 
			function. UDDI also defines a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) 
			that can be used by applications and services to directly interact with UDDI 
			data. For example, you can develop services that automatically publish and 
			update their UDDI data, react dynamically to service availability, or 
			automatically discover interface details for other services with which they 
			interact.</p>
		<p>
			The UDDI.org consortium of companies established the UDDI Business Registry 
			(UBR) where companies and organizations can share and discover Web services. 
			This public registry is maintained and replicated by its managing body, the UBR 
			Operator Council, and should not be confused with
			UDDI&nbsp;Services, which is deployed and maintained by your 
			enterprise or organization.

		<h2>Understanding
			UDDI&nbsp;Services
			entities and organization</h2>
		<p>
			UDDI&nbsp;Services
			provides UDDI capabilities for use within an enterprise or between business 
			partners. It includes a Web interface with searching, publishing, and 
			coordination features that are compatible with Microsoft Internet 
			Explorer&nbsp;4.0 or later and Netscape Navigator 4.5 or later.
			UDDI&nbsp;Services
			supports the UDDI version&nbsp;1.0 and&nbsp;2.0 APIs, enabling enterprise 
			developers to publish, discover, share, and interact with Web services directly 
			through their development tools and business applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			Organizations and the products and services they provide are represented by the 
			following entities in
			UDDI&nbsp;Services:

			The following definitions describe each entity and its role in relation to 
			other entities:
		</p>
		<p>
			<a name="provider"></a><img src="images\business.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="provider" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<b>Provider</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A party—any business, or physical or conceptual 
			group—that offers one or more XML Web services. For example, a business, 
			business unit, organization, organizational department, person, computer, or an 
			application can be a provider in
			UDDI&nbsp;Services. In the
			UDDI&nbsp;Services
			data structure, a provider represents the "parent" entity under which all 
			contact, service, and interface information is stored and organized.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a name="contact"></a><img src="images\contact.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="contact" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<b>Contact</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A human or computer resource that can be contacted 
			for information about a provider or the XML Web services it offers. A provider 
			may have as many contacts as is necessary to identify each of its available 
			contact points.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a name="service"></a><img src="images\service.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="service" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<b>Service</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; An entity in
			UDDI&nbsp;Services
			that describes and provides access to a function that you would like to share 
			with other
			UDDI&nbsp;Services
			users. Services can perform any function across a network, from simple requests 
			to complicated business processes. A stock ticker feed and an online 
			procurement system are each examples of functions that can be published as a 
			service. Services may have one or more <i>bindings</i>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a name="binding"></a><img src="images\binding.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="binding" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<b>Binding</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The point where a specific implementation of a 
			service can be accessed, such as the URL where an interface can be found. 
			Bindings may also include one or more <i>instance info</i> structures.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a name="instance"></a><img src="images\instance.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="instance info" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<b>Instance Info</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A reference to a tModel that contains relevant 
			technical information about a binding, such as an interface specification 
			document or Web Services Description Language (WSDL) file.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a name="tmodel"></a><img src="images\tmodel.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="tModel" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<b>tModel</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; tModels are typically used to provide technical 
			information about an interface, such as a Web Service Description Language 
			(WSDL) file, that describes the conventions that are supported by an interface. 
			tModels are also used to represent an organized unit of descriptive data, such 
			as an identification or categorization scheme. How tModels are used in your 
			implementation may vary, depending on your organization's Web services 
			publishing data model.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each entity is defined by one or more of the following attributes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Categorization Scheme</b>
			&nbsp;&nbsp; A collection of categories and subcategories used to describe and 
			locate providers, services, and tModels. A categorization scheme may contain 
			public classifications, such as the North American Industry Classification 
			System (NAICS). It may also contain company-defined categorizations. For 
			example, useful categorization schemes might be constructed around geographical 
			locations, industry segments, or a company's organizational structure. 
			Categorization provides a consistent means by which users can search for 
			providers and services or locate interfaces of a particular type, location, or 
			other attribute.
			<li>
				<b>Overview Document URL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; An address of a Hypertext Transfer 
				Protocol (HTTP)-accessible resource that hosts data or information you would 
				like to associate with an entity. For example, a tModel overview document might 
				provide the URL to an interface definition or Web Service Description Language 
				(WSDL) file that provides technical information that is required to invoke a 
				service through an interface. For an <i>instance info</i>, an overview 
			document might provide additional technical information that is only applicable 
			to a specific implementation of an interface.
			<li>
				<b>Discovery URL</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; An HTTP-accessible resource that typically 
				responds to an HTTP-GET request with technical information describing a 
				provider. When a provider is created,
				UDDI&nbsp;Services
				automatically creates a discovery URL pointing to that provider's 
				businessEntity within that installation of
				UDDI&nbsp;Services.
			<li>
				<b>Identifier</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; An organization-wide identification scheme 
			used to logically group providers and tModels by a common form of 
			identification, such as a cost code or D-U-N-S® Number. Identifiers are 
			optional descriptions and are intended to enhance the discovery of providers 
			and tModels in search operations.
			<li>
				<b>Relationships</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The identity, parent-child or peer-peer 
			relationships between providers. Relationships are useful, for example, when 
			describing an organizational structure or advertising business partnerships.
			<li>
				<b>Instance Parameters</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The settings or parameters that are 
				supported by an instance of a binding. An instance parameter may be either a 
				list of settings and parameters or the URL of a file that contains a list of 
				supported settings and parameters.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<a name="#ROLES"></a>
		<h2>UDDI&nbsp;Services
			Roles</h2>
		<p>
			UDDI&nbsp;Services
			contains four roles that define the level of interaction that each user is 
			allowed.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>User</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; An individual who can only query
				UDDI&nbsp;Services
			for Web service information. Any partner or organization with whom you would 
			like to share your Web services data must be part of, at minimum, the User 
			group. By default, the User group&nbsp;uses the local computer group 
			BUILTIN\Users.
			<li>
				<b>Publisher</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; An individual who can query and publish in
				UDDI&nbsp;Services. A Publisher can add entities to
				UDDI&nbsp;Services
			or modify any of the entities that they own. By default, the Publisher 
			group&nbsp;uses the local computer group BUILTIN\Administrators.
			<li>
				<b>Coordinator</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; An individual who can query, publish, and 
				configure data in the
				UDDI&nbsp;Services
				Web-based user interface. In addition to Publisher user rights, a Coordinator 
				can view and modify any data stored in
				UDDI&nbsp;Services
			, change entity ownerships, import categorization schemes, and generate and 
			view statistical reports. By default, the Coordinator group&nbsp;uses the local 
			computer group BUILTIN\Administrators.
			<li>
				<b>Administrator</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; An individual who can query, publish, 
				coordinate, and administer
				UDDI&nbsp;Services. In addition to Coordinator user rights for 
				the Web-based user interface, an Administrator can administer service options, 
				manage security settings, perform backups, and carry out other administrative 
				tasks at the system level by using the
				UDDI&nbsp;Services
				Web user interface and Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in and command 
				line tools. By default, the Administrator group&nbsp;uses the local computer 
				group BUILTIN\Administrators.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The user name and role are displayed in the upper-right corner of the UDDI 
			Services Web interface.
		</p>
		<a name="#WHATNEXT"></a>
		<h2>What’s Next</h2>
		<p>
			Now that you have reviewed entities, roles, and relationships in
			UDDI&nbsp;Services, you are ready to deploy, configure, and use
			UDDI&nbsp;Services
			in your organization.
