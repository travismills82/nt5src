				<b>Administrator</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; An individual who can query, publish, 
				coordinate, and administer
				UDDI&nbsp;Services. In addition to Coordinator user rights for 
				the Web-based user interface, an Administrator can administer service options, 
				manage security settings, perform backups, and carry out other administrative 
				tasks at the system level by using the
				UDDI&nbsp;Services
				Web user interface, Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in and command line 
				tools. By default, the Administrator group&nbsp;uses the local computer group 
				BUILTIN\Administrators.

				<h1><A name="c"></A>C</h1>
			<li>
				<b>Categorization Scheme</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A collection of categories and 
			subcategories used to describe and locate providers, services, and tModels. A 
			categorization scheme may contain public classifications, such as the North 
			American Industry Classification System (NAICS). It may also contain 
			company-defined categorizations. For example, useful categorization schemes 
			might be constructed around geographical locations, industry segments, or a 
			company's organizational structure. Categorization provides a consistent means 
			by which users can search for providers and services or locate interfaces of a 
			particular type, location, or other attribute.
			<li>
				<img src="images\contact.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="contact" border="0">&nbsp;
				<b>Contact</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A human or computer resource that can be 
			contacted for information about a provider or the XML Web services it offers. A 
			provider may have as many contacts as is necessary to identify each of its 
			available contact points.
			<li>
				<b>Coordinator</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; An individual who can query, publish, and 
				configure data in the
				UDDI&nbsp;Services
				Web-based user interface. In addition to Publisher user rights, a Coordinator 
				can view and modify any data stored in
				UDDI&nbsp;Services, change entity ownerships, import 
				categorization schemes, and generate and view statistical reports. By default, 
				the Coordinator group&nbsp;uses the local computer group 
				BUILTIN\Administrators.

				<h1><A name="d"></A>D</h1>
			<li>
				<b>Discovery URL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; An HTTP-accessible resource that typically 
				responds to an HTTP-GET request with technical information describing a 
				provider. When a provider is created,
				UDDI&nbsp;Services
				automatically creates a discovery URL pointing to that provider's 
				businessEntity within that installation of
				UDDI&nbsp;Services.
				<HR align="left" color="#000000" noShade>
				<div align="center"><A href="#TopPage">Back to top</A></div>
				<h1><A name="i"></A>I</h1>
			<li>
				<b>Identifier</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; An organization-wide identification scheme 
			used to logically group providers and tModels by a common form of 
			identification, such as a cost code or D-U-N-S® Number. Identifiers are 
			optional descriptions and are intended to enhance the discovery of providers 
			and tModels in search operations.
			<li>
				<img src="images\instance.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="instance info" border="0">&nbsp;
				<b>Instance Info</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A reference to a tModel that contains 
			relevant technical information about a binding, such as an interface 
			specification document or Web Services Description Language (WSDL) file.
			<li>
				<b>Instance Parameters</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The settings or parameters that are 
			supported by an instance of a binding. An instance parameter may be either a 
			list of settings and parameters or the URL of a file that contains a list of 
			supported settings and parameters.
			<li>
				<b>Interface</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The address or location where a service or 
				application can be invoked. For example, a weather report Web service might 
				publish a single interface: http://www.mycompany.com/weather.asmx
				<HR align="left" color="#000000" noShade>
				<div align="center"><A href="#TopPage">Back to top</A></div>
				<h1><A name="o"></A>O</h1>
			<li>
				<b>Overview Document URL</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; An address of an Hypertext Transfer 
				Protocol (HTTP)-accessible resource that hosts data or information you would 
				like to associate with an entity. For example, a tModel overview document might 
				provide the URL to an interface definition or Web Service Description Language 
				(WSDL) file that provides technical information that is required to invoke a 
				service through an interface. For an instance info, an overview document might 
				provide additional technical information that is only applicable to a specific 
				implementation of an interface.

				<b>Provider</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A party—any business, or physical or conceptual 
				group—that offers one or more XML Web services. For example, a business, 
				business unit, organization, organizational department, person, computer, or an 
				application can be a provider in
				UDDI&nbsp;Services. In the UDDI&nbsp;Services data 
			structure, a provider represents the "parent" entity under which all contact, 
			service, and interface information is stored and organized.
			<li>
				<b>Publisher</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; An individual who can query and publish in UDDI 
				Services. A Publisher can add entities to
				UDDI&nbsp;Services
				or modify any of the entities that they own. By default, the Publisher 
				group&nbsp;uses the local computer group BUILTIN\Administrators.

				<h1><A name="r"></A>R</h1>
			<li>
				<b>Relationships</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The identity, parent-child or peer-peer 
				relationships between providers. Relationships are useful, for example, when 
				describing an organizational structure or advertising business partnerships.

				<b>Service</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; An entity in
				UDDI&nbsp;Services
				that describes and provides access to a function you would like to share with 
				other
				UDDI&nbsp;Services
				users. Services can perform any function across a network, from simple requests 
				to complicated business processes. A stock ticker feed and an online 
				procurement system are each examples of functions that can be published as a 
				service. Services may have one or more <i>bindings</i>.
			<LI>
				<b>Site</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A complete installation of all
				UDDI&nbsp;Services
			components, including at least one Web server component connected to a database 
			component.

				<b>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A World Wide Web 
				Consortium (W3C) standard, lightweight protocol for exchange of information in 
				a decentralized, distributed environment. SOAP is an Extensible Markup Language 
				(XML)-based protocol that consists of three parts: an envelope that defines a 
				framework for describing what is in a message and how to process it; a set of 
				encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined data types; and 
				a convention for representing remote procedure calls and responses.

				<h1><A name="t"></A>T</h1>
			<li>
				<img src="images\tmodel.gif" height="16" width="16" alt="tModel" border="0">&nbsp;
				<b>tModel</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; tModels are typically used to provide technical 
				information about an interface, such as a Web Service Description Language 
				(WSDL) file, that describes the conventions that are supported by an interface. 
				tModels are also used to represent an organized unit of descriptive data, such 
				as an identification or categorization scheme. How tModels are used in your 
				implementation may vary, depending upon your organization's Web services 
				publishing data model.

				<h1><A name="u"></A>U</h1>
			<li>
				<b>Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			An industry specification for publishing and locating information about Web 
			services. It provides a standards-based way to store and retrieve information 
			about services, service providers, binding information, and technical interface 
			definitions, all classified using a set of standard or custom classification 
			schemes.
