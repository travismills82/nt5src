					<H1>Introduction to Publishing</H1>
					<p>
					The information presented in this introduction relies upon your understanding of how information is organized in UDDI&nbsp;Services. If you are not yet familiar with this, please review the <a href="intro.whatisuddi.aspx">Introduction to UDDI&nbsp;Services</a> before proceeding.</p>
					<p>
					With UDDI&nbsp;Services, you can publish and share information about XML Web services with other users and applications. When you publish a Web service using UDDI&nbsp;Services, you are providing the information that is necessary for these users and applications to <i>locate</i> and <i>interact</i> with your service. While you are adding, editing, and deleting information in UDDI&nbsp;Services, always ensure that your modifications are accurate and will not affect any other service publications adversely. Additions, modifications, and deletions to data are immediate and permanent.
					
					<h2>Publishing Guidelines</h2>
					Before you begin publishing, you should identify how your Web service publications are going to be organized. A consistent organization and modeling of data will help to ensure that all participants can locate and interact with your services quickly and efficiently. Your UDDI&nbsp;Services coordinator should have additional information about your organization's publishing guidelines.<p>
<P>Publishing guidelines should include:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>A description and example of the type of organization or grouping that a provider represents.</li>
					<LI>A naming convetion for your providers, services, and tModels.</li>
					<li>A description of the modeling and example of a service publication structure.</li>
					<li>The names and descriptions of any tModels representing standard interface definitions available.</li>
					<li>The names and descriptions of any categorization schemes or identifications schemes that should be used.</li>
					</ul>
					
					 The purpose of your publications is to provide others with a means of discovering and interacting with your services. Name, describe, categorize, and give details about each entity that you publish to help ensure that they are discovered and used as intended. For additional publication and information regarding best practices, see Additional Resources on the UDDI&nbsp;Services page on the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=5202&amp;clcid=0x409" target="_blank"> Microsoft Web site</a>.
					<p>
					Now that you understand how information is published in UDDI&nbsp;Services, you should read the <a href="publish.gettingstarted.aspx">Step-by-Step-Guide to Publishing a Web Service</a>.
