<b>Categorization Scheme</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A collection of categories and 
subcategories used to describe and locate providers, services, and tModels. A 
categorization scheme may contain public classifications, such as the North 
American Industry Classification System (NAICS). It may also contain 
company-defined categorizations. For example, useful categorization schemes 
might be constructed around geographical locations, industry segments, or a 
company's organizational structure. Categorization provides a consistent means 
by which users may search for providers and services or locate interfaces of a 
particular type, location, or other attribute.
