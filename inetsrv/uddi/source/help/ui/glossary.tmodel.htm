<b>tModel</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; tModels are typically used to provide technical 
information about an interface, such as a Web Service Description Language 
(WSDL) file, that describes the conventions that are supported by an interface. 
tModels are also used to represent an organized unit of descriptive data, such 
as an identification or categorization scheme. How tModels are used in your 
implementation may vary, depending upon your organization's Web services 
publishing data model.
