# To change of extension from .manifest to .man is done for at least two reasons
#   we reuse infrastructure that wants 8.3 names, for the CD
#   it avoids #include path ambiguity, like we don't have foo.manifest in .\ and .\obj\i386.
#
# better extensions would perhaps be .mansrc and .manobj or .manifestsrc/.manifestobj or .manifest-src/.manifest-obj
# There is some support for .manifest-src in makefile.def.
# This is all easy to add support for, about one line per combination in makefile.def.
