<p>A filter is a set of rules that allow you to screen files on your server
appliance. Use filters to include and exclude directories and files in the file screening
process. &nbsp;For example, a screening directory called C:\Users may contain multiple
  subdirectories.&nbsp; As another example, you can also exclude C:\Users\Administrator
      from being screened.</p>

<p><b>Exclude Filters</b></p>

<p>Use exclude filters to refine the
screening policy to a set of directories or files within a directory. For example,
you may want to screen the C:\User directory but 
exclude any .tmp files.
You can use wildcards when setting filters.</p>

<p><b>Include Filters</b></p>

 Use include filters to refine the screening policy to a set of directories
or files within a directory. For example, you can screen only the *\Temporary
Internet Files directories under the C:\Winnt\Profiles directory. This is useful when applying file screening policies to a large set of directories
contained in a parent directory.&nbsp;You can use wildcards when setting filters.</p>
