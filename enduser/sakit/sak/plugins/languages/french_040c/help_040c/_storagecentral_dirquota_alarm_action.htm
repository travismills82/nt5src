    <LI><B>Best Practices</B> This report is a representation of storage 
    management best practices that are a good starting point for disk space 
    analysis. The Best Practice reports give an overall indication of your 
    systems storage health. The report identifies file types, duplicate files, 
    files not backed up, most commonly-used files, and nightly backup capacity 
    requirements. 
    <LI><B>Duplicate Files&nbsp;</B>This report identifies duplicate files that 
    may use an excessive amount of space, which helps you clean up disk space 
    quickly. 
    <LI><B>File Type Summary </B>This report provides usage details for the 
    directory. 
    <LI><B>Files Not Being Backed Up </B>This report identifies files that have 
    been modified but have not been backed up according to the NTFS file system 
    archive bit.This bit is used 
    by backup applications to indicate a file's backup status. This validates file recoverability 
    and protects your data. 
    <LI><B>Large Files </B>This report identifies large files that have 
    not been accessed for 60 days. This is useful to reclaim unused disk 
    capacity, identify archive candidates, and reduce backup and recovery times. 

    <LI><B>Most Commonly Used Files </B>This report displays the amount of raw 
    capacity accessed each day.This is useful for balancing applications, data, and users across 
    available resources, and to prevent underutilized or overburdened file 
    servers. 
    <LI><B>Directory Quota Usage Summary </B> This report identifies all of the directory quotas defined on the appliance and displays the space used, space free, percent used, and highwater mark.
