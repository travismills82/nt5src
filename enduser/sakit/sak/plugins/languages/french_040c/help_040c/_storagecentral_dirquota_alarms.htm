Alarms</H1>
<P>Alarms are used to notify a user and the administrator when a quota event 
occurs. Each directory quota has two alarms, each with its own settings. Quota 
events are based on increasing and decreasing disk space allocation.</P>
<P>There are two types of directory quota alarms: severe and warning.&nbsp; Each 
alarm contains the attributes which are differentiated by threshold 
values.&nbsp; The threshold value equals the percentage of the space limit 
used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>An alarm is only activated once until the used space drops below the 
threshold. For example, if the severe alarm threshold value is 90% and warning 
alarm threshold value is 70% and the space used is 71%, the warning alarm is 
activated.&nbsp; The warning alarm will not be activated again until the 
percentage drops below 70%. </P>
<P>If the current space limit exceeds any of the thresholds, the corresponding 
quota actions are executed. Alarms that activate numerous times within a few 
seconds are discarded.</P>
