<p>Report sets are a predefined list of storage reports that are generated as a group.&nbsp; The
following report sets are provided with the storage reports feature:</p>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Best Practices</B> This 
  report is a representation of storage management best practices that are a 
  good starting point for disk space analysis. The Best Practice reports give an 
  overall indication of your systems storage health. The report identifies file 
  types, duplicate files, files not backed up, most commonly-used files, and 
  nightly backup capacity requirements. 
  <LI><B>Duplicate Files&nbsp;</B>This 
  report identifies duplicate files that may use an excessive amount of space, 
  which helps you clean up disk space quickly. 
  <LI><B>File Type Summary </B>This report 
  provides usage details for the directory.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes" 
  >&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN> 
  <LI><B>Files Not Being Backed Up 
  </B>This report identifies files that have been modified but have not been 
  backed up according to the NTFS file system archive bit.<SPAN 
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This bit is used 
  by backup applications to indicate a file's backup status.<SPAN 
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This validates 
  file recoverability and protects your data. 
  <LI><B>Large Files </B>This report 
  identifies large files that have not been accessed for 60 days. This is useful 
  to reclaim unused disk capacity, identify archive candidates, and reduce 
  backup and recovery times. 
  <LI><B>Most Commonly Used Files 
  </B>This report displays the amount of raw capacity accessed each day.This is useful 
  for balancing applications, data, and users across available resources, and to 
  prevent underutilized or overburdened file servers.
  <LI><STRONG>Directory Quota Usage Summary </STRONG> This report identifies 
  all of the directory quotas defined on the appliance and displays the space 
  used, space free, percent used, and highwater mark.<STRONG> </STRONG></LI></UL>
