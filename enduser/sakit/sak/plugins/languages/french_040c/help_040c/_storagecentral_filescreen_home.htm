<p> File screening prevents unwanted files
from being saved on your server appliance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only do these
files increase backup times and consume valuable disk space, they can also
put your company at risk of violating piracy and discrimination laws.</p>

<p>         
    The proliferation of Internet communication in the 
workplace has allowed users to download questionable files to a server 
appliance.         
    File screening can prevent files containing&nbsp;objectionable graphic images,
games, or video from polluting your server appliance. File screening provides a
fast and easy way to prevent unwanted file types from using valuable
corporate server storage.</p>

<p>File screening includes the following features:</p>
<UL>
  <li>Active and passive file screening on directories 
  <li>Best practice file 
  screening policies 
  <li>Notification alarm when file screening policy is 
  violated 
  <li>Audit database containing screened files 
  <li>Customized alarm messages 
  <li> Alarm messages to the event log 
  <li> Alarm messages to a user 
  <li>Storage reports when alarm is activated and sent to 
  intranet Web&nbsp;site 
  <li> Custom script when alarm is activated</li></UL>

<P>File screening is organized in a 
hierarchy with the&nbsp;directory object being the top node. The node under the 
directory object contains a set of file screening policies.&nbsp; An object can 
be any disk allocation and can be associated with any screening policy. The 
figure below illustrates the hierarchy.</P>

<P>Use caution when placing screening parameters on the system partition. If 
certain classes of files are screened from the system partition, the operating 
system may not have the access to save temporary working files. It is a good 
idea to exclude systems directories from screening. Another option is to create 
a passive screening policy that allows files to be saved but the file activity 
to be logged.</P>
