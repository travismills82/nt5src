<h1>Uninterruptible Power Supply Overview</h1>

<p>                                                                                                                 Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) provides emergency backup power 
for a specific period of time when                                                       the local power fails. This power comes from batteries housed within the UPS. High-performance surge suppression protects your server appliance from electrical noise and damaging power surges. During a power failure, the UPS instantly switches your server appliance to emergency battery backup power.</p>

<p>   Once you have installed a UPS for your server appliance, 
you can set options for its operation using the&nbsp;<STRONG>UPS</STRONG>                      task on the <b>Maintenance</b> page. The UPS task enables you to control how the UPS service works on your server appliance. The available UPS settings depend on the specific UPS hardware installed on your system. Before you use your UPS device, type the following information on the <b>UPS Configuration</b> page:</p>
<UL>
<li>   UPS device manufacturer
  
<li>UPS device model 
  <LI>The serial port to which the UPS device is connected </LI>
</UL>
<p>To configure the UPS service, choose <b>UPS</b> from the <b>Maintenance</b>     page.</p>

<p>To ensure that the server appliance is protected from power failures, test it by simulating a power failure. Do this by disconnecting the main power supply from the UPS device. Your server appliance and peripherals connected to the UPS device should remain operational, messages should be displayed, and events should be logged. Wait until the UPS battery reaches a low level to verify that a graceful shutdown occurs. Restore the main power to the UPS device, and check the event log to verify that all actions were logged and there were no errors.</p>

<p> All detected power fluctuations and power failures are recorded in the event log, along with UPS service start failures and server shutdown initiations. Critical events may change the status of the server appliance.</p>
