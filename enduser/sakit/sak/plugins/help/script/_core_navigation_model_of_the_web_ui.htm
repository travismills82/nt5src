<P>The top of each page of the Web UI is composed of a status area, as well as primary and secondary navigation bars. The body of each page of the Web UI is composed of the content area.  </P>

<P>Following is a description of these sections:</P>

<P class="label"><B>Status Area</B></P>

<P>The top band of the window, the status area displays, from left to right:

<UL type="disc">
	<LI>Manufacturer logo (Optional)</li>

	<LI>Server host name and status</li>

	<LI>Microsoft Windows logo </li>
</UL>

<P>There are four possible <B>Status</B> displays: 

<UL type="disc">
	<LI><B>Normal</B> (green text)</li>

	<LI><B>Information</B> (gray text)</li>

	<LI><B>Warning</B> (yellow text) </li>

	<LI><B>Critical</B> (red text)</li>
</UL>

<P>You can click <B>Status: &lt;status type&gt;</B> to get detailed information about the status of the server.</P>

<P class="label"><B>Navigation Bars</B></P>

<P>Immediately below the status area are the navigation bars. The following illustration shows the primary (blue) and secondary (gray) navigation bars. </P>

<P class="fig"><IMG SRC="navbar.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>The primary navigation bar lists the available Web UI tasks by type. The secondary navigation bar lists subtasks available for the selected primary task. The secondary navigation bar is dynamic, and the available task types change depending upon the task group selected.</P>

<P>Rollover text for items in the navigation bars provides even more information. Move the mouse cursor over each item to display the rollover text.</P>

<P class="label"><B>Content Area</B></P>

<P>Page information is displayed in the content area, located below the menu bars. This section of the Web UI describes the management activities you can perform on that page. This text may also provide instructions about tools available to perform the selected tasks.</P>

<P>Many of the task pages include an Object/Task Selector. The Object/Task Selector is simply a table listing the objects you can manage or configure, their descriptions, and the tasks you can perform. The leftmost column of the Object/Task Selector contains a radio button you click to select a given object. In the event that multiple objects in the Object/Task Selector, can be selected, the leftmost column will contain a check box rather than a radio button. The rightmost column lists the tasks you can perform.</P>

<P class="labelproc"><B>To navigate through the Web UI</B>

<OL type="1">
	<LI>On the primary navigation bar, click the general type of task you want to perform. </li>

	<LI>On the secondary navigation bar or in the list of tasks in the content area of the page, click the specific type of task you want to perform. </li>

	<LI>In the content area of the subsequent page:
<OL type="a">
	<LI>If an Object/Task Selector is available, select the object you want to manage or configure by clicking the radio button to the left of the object name. Then select the task you want to perform from the <B>Tasks</B> list on the right. Depending on the page, the Object/Task Selector may provide search capabilities, as well as the ability to page though the information contained in the table.</li>

	<LI>If an Object/Task Selector is not available, enter the data in the fields indicated to accomplish the chosen task.</li>
</OL>
</li>

	<LI>When you are finished with each task, choose <B>OK</B> to confirm your changes, or <B>Cancel</B> to retain the previous settings. </li>
</OL>

<BLOCKQUOTE class="dtBlock">
Once the change or cancellation has processed, the previous page will display.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If you are on a property page and select another navigation bar item, a pop-up window displays with the message <B>Click OK to discard any changes</B>. This gives you the chance to either commit to or reject the changes before moving to the next selected page.</P>
