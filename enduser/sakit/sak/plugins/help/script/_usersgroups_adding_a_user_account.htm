<P>When you add a user account, you should include a user name, the user's full name, a brief description of the account, and an account password. </P>

<P>Keep in mind that user names must be unique, and must not duplicate the name of any existing group.</P>

<P>A user name cannot be identical to any other user or group name on the computer being administered. A user name can contain up to 20 uppercase or lowercase characters except for the following: " / \ [ ] : ; | = , + * ? &lt; &gt;. Additionally, a user name cannot consist solely of periods (.) or spaces.</P>

<P>In the <B>Password </B>and <B>Confirm password</B> boxes, you can type a password containing up to 127 characters. However, if you are using Windows server software on a network that also has computers using Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98, consider using passwords that contain fewer than 14 characters. Windows 95 and Windows 98 support passwords that contain up to 14 characters. If your password is longer, you may not be able to log on to your network from those computers. </P>

<P>The only new users you should add to the administrators group are those that will be solely performing administrative tasks. </P>
