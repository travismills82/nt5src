<P>Windows networking components rely on the NetBIOS naming convention. In contrast, TCP/IP components rely on a naming convention known as the Domain Name System (DNS). Under Windows, the DNS host name defaults to the same name as the NetBIOS computer name. The mapping of computer names to IP addresses can be accomplished using one of the following two methods:

<UL type="disc">
	<LI><B>Static&#0151;</B>The system administrator creates either a text file for DNS names, called a HOSTS file, or an LMHOSTS file for NetBIOS names, and enters each computer's name and IP address. The file is then distributed on the network. When a request for a connection to another computer is made, the file is used to resolve the name with the correct IP address. This system works well for simple networks that change infrequently. </li>

	<LI><B>Dynamic&#0151;</B>When a client computer logs on, a DHCP server assigns an address and sends the IP address assignment to a Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server. The WINS server registers the computer's name, and when a request is made for a NetBIOS computer name, the WINS server resolves the name to the correct IP address. This automatic recognition and mapping of computer names and addresses eases the administrative burden of large or frequently changing networks. </li>
</UL>

<P>DNS names are typically resolved using static information. The DNS server contains a portion of the static database listing host names and addresses. If the requested name is not in the DNS server's portion of the database, it sends a query to other DNS servers to get the requested information. The DNS server that runs on Windows can be configured to query a WINS server for name resolution of the lower levels of the DNS hierarchical naming structure. Because WINS assigns computer names dynamically, this effectively changes DNS from a static system to a dynamic system.</P>

<P>If you are setting up multiple Web or FTP sites on a single server, each with its own IP address, you might encounter problems with automatic DNS registration. To ensure correct IP binding and DNS registration, disable automatic DNS registration and manually configure DNS registration for the Web sites. For more information about disabling automatic DNS registration and manually configuring DNS registration, see the general Windows Help.</P>

<P>If you want to assign multiple names to one server, you must use a static name assignment for the server. On one computer you can map multiple names to one IP address or you can use multiple names, each one mapped to its own IP address.</P>
