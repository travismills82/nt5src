<P>The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is integrated with the Windows security model. Users connecting using FTP are authenticated based on the user accounts on the server. They receive access based on those user profiles. Keep in mind, however, that the FTP server relies on the ability to send user passwords over the network without data encryption. As a result, a user with physical access to the network could examine user passwords during the FTP validation process.</P>

<P>FTP supports all Microsoft Windows FTP client commands, when a server is running FTP, other computers using the FTP utility can connect to the server and transfer files. On the other hand, non-Microsoft versions of FTP clients might contain commands that are not supported by the FTP server protocol. </P>
