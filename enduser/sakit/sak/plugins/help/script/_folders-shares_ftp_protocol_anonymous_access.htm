<P>Allowing anonymous access to the FTP server enables users to connect with the user name <I>anonymous</I>&#0151;or <I>ftp</I>, which is a synonym for <I>anonymous</I>. A password is not necessary, but the user is prompted to supply an e-mail address as the password. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE class="dtBlock">
<b class="le">Note</b><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>You cannot access the FTP server from a Microsoft Windows Server user account with the name <I>anonymous.</I> The <I>anonymous</I> user name is reserved in the FTP server for the anonymous logon function. Users logging on to the server with the user name <I>anonymous</I> receive permissions based on the FTP server configuration for anonymous logons.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>After the FTP protocol software is installed on your computer, you must configure the software to operate. Your FTP server protocol settings will result in one of the following configurations: 

<UL type="disc">
	<LI>No anonymous FTP connection to the server allowed. In this case, each user must provide a valid Windows user name and password. To configure the FTP server protocol for this setting, clear the <B>Enable anonymous connection</B> check box on the <B>FTP Protocol Properties</B> page.</li>

	<LI>Allow both anonymous and Windows users to connect to the FTP server. This configuration allows a user to use either an anonymous connection or a Windows user name and password. To configure the FTP server protocol for this setting, select only the <B>Enable anonymous connection</B> check box in the <B>FTP Protocol Properties</B> page.</li>

	<LI>Allow only anonymous FTP connections to the server. In this case, a user cannot connect to the FTP server using a Windows user name and password. To configure the FTP server protocol for this setting, select both the <B>Enable anonymous connections</B> and the <B>Allow only anonymous access </B>check boxes in the <B>FTP Protocol Properties</B> page.</li>
</UL>

<P>If anonymous connections are allowed, you must supply the Windows user name and password that will provide anonymous access to the FTP server. When an anonymous FTP transfer occurs, Windows verifies the user name assigned in this dialog box to determine whether access is allowed to the files. </P>
