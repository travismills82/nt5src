<P>This property page allows you to enter the addresses of external WINS servers. The server may or may not contain a WINS server. For the purpose discussed here, the server is a WINS client. </P>

<P>WINS-enabled client computers can be configured to make direct use of a WINS server. Most WINS client computers typically have more than one network basic input/output system (NetBIOS) name that they must register with the network. These names are used to publish various types of network service, such as the Messenger or Workstation Service that each computer can use in various ways to communicate with other computers on the network.</P>

<P>WINS-enabled clients communicate with the WINS server to allow you to complete the following tasks:

<UL type="disc">
	<LI>Register client names in the WINS database. </li>

	<LI>Renew client names with the WINS database. </li>

	<LI>Release client names from the WINS database. </li>

	<LI>Resolve names by obtaining mappings from the WINS database for user names, NetBIOS names, DNS names, and IP addresses. </li>
</UL>

<P>Clients that are not WINS-enabled can use WINS proxies to participate in these processes in a limited way. If you are using a DHCP server to allocate WINS server IP addresses, you do not need to add WINS server addresses. </P>

<P>Keep in mind that the Web UI only allows you to manipulate two WINS addresses, and even then only if you statically assign the IP address for the adapter. If you have DHCP enabled, you can remove one or two existing addresses and add different addresses, but you will not be able to remove all WINS servers from a DHCP-enabled adapter. If you remove two WINS addresses and do not add at least one, DHCP will automatically assign WINS addresses.</P>

<P>WINS clients attempt to register their names with a WINS server when they start or join the network. Thereafter, WINS clients query the WINS server as needed to resolve remote names.</P>
