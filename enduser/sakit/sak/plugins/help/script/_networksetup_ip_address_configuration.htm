<P>Each computer on the network must have a unique IP address to send and receive data. If a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server is present on your network, you can use the <B>IP Address Configuration</B> page to have your server automatically obtain the IP address configuration from a DHCP server. Alternately, you can configure the IP address(es) manually. </P>

<P>In addition, you can specify one or more <I>gateway addresses</I>. A gateway address is the address of a local IP router residing on the same network as the server that is used to forward traffic to destinations beyond the local network. The value in each field must be a number from 0&#0150;255.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE class="dtBlock">

	<LI>Type the appropriate mask information in the <B>Subnet mask</B> box.
<P>A <I>subnet mask </I>is a 32-bit number that is notated by using four numbers from 0&#0150;255, separated by periods. Typically, default subnet mask numbers use either 0 or 255 as values, such as 255.255.255.0. However, other numeric values can appear, indicating that the subnet is configured for a single TCP/IP network. This number, with a value other than 0 or 255, is combined with the IP address number to identify the network on which your computer resides. 
</li>

	<LI>If necessary, update the <B>IP Connection Metric</B>. 
<P>The metric indicates the cost of using the routes associated with this connection and becomes the value in the Metric column for those routes in the IP routing table. If there are multiple routes to a destination the route with the lowest metric is used. The default value is 1.
