<p class="clsPTitle"> Corporate Error Reporting</p>

<p class="clsPBody">Corporate Error Reporting (CER) is a tool designed for Administrators to manage error reports created by the Windows<sup>&#174;</sup> Error Reporting client, as well as Error Reporting clients shipped with applications.  If the Error Reporting clients are configured for CER, the Error Reports are redirected to a network share available through a Universal Naming Convention (UNC). As a result, Administrators in the Information Technology (IT) department can use the Corporate Error Reporting tool to review the redirected error reports and filter the reports that are sent to Microsoft<sup>&#174;</sup> through the CER tool based on your corporate policies and the data contained within the error report.</p>
