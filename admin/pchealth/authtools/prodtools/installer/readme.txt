The Windows Installer is flaky and keeps on wanting to copy files like hh.exe.

This is what I really want:

Application Folder:
    AuthDatabase.dll
    ProductionTool.exe
    HSC.chm

    Desktop.mdb
    Server.mdb

    Readme.rtf
    WalkThrough.ppt

Windows System Folder:
    cabarc.exe
