The following changes were made to the existing WhoamI.exe utility-

1. A switch ( /NOVERBOSE ) has been  removed
2. A new switch ( /V ) has been added for displaying the output in verbose mode.
3. Added a function (DoParseParam ) to get the command line arguments.
4. Removed all the _tprintf statements and replaced them with ShowMessage().
5. Supported all UNICODE conversions i.,e WCHAR, LPWSTR etc...
5. Implemented to display  the output in three formats i.,e LIST, TABLE and CSV
5. The help/usage has been changed completely.
6. Files called error.cpp , wsdisplay.cpp and wsstring.cpp  have been removed as we are using common functionality to    display the proper error messages and results in CSV,LIST or TABLE formats.
8. Added a function to format the messages  for error codes i.,e in case of any API failure.
9. Moved all the strings to the .rc file.
10. Remote connectivity have been supported.
11) Old utility was not implemented for /LOGONID. I implemented the same.

FUNCTIONAL CHANGES ( Clarifications required):
--------------------------------------
1) According to old utility ,  "WHOAMI  /ALL  /NOVERBOSE" command displays the values for  user, groups, privileges and logonID without displaying the column names.  By default it displays all the values along with the column names .

Instead, I added /V switch for displaying the output in verbose mode. Default display is non-verbose mode.

For "WHOAMI /PRIV /V" , I am displaying  privileges which are enabled/disabled.
For "WHOAMI /PRIV " , I am  displaying the privileges which are enabled.
I feel,  /V option is meaningful only for /PRIV option.. it doesnt have any meaning for commands like
"WHOAMI /USER /V" or "WHOAMI /GROUPS /V" or "WHOAMI /LOGONID /V" as we need to display the column names in both non-verbose as well as verbose modes.

 Please do clarify on this.


2) According to old utility  help/usage, /SID option must be given with one of  /USER, /GROUPS, /LOGONID or /PRIV options.  But according to old source code,  /SID option must be given with either /USER or /GROUPS options only.
/SID option doesn't have any meaning with /LOGONID or /PRIV options.
Thats why I implemented like  /SID option is only applicable for /USER and /GROUPS.

3) According to old utility, it is accepting options like /USER, /GROUPS, /LOGONID or /PRIV along with /ALL option.
Actually /ALL option itself means that it is combination of /USER, /GROUPS, /LOGONID and /PRIV. Thats why I implemeted like /USER, /GROUPS, /LOGONID , /SID and  /PRIV are not applicable with the /ALL option.

4) I implemented for remote connectivity. But on the remote system all the options are giving local system values only..
For "WHOAMI /GROUPS /S SERVER" api itself is getting failed.

Please do clarify on the above.
