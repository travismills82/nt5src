The following changes were made to the existing Timeout.exe utility-

1. We have added a new switch ( /T ) for entering the timeout value.
2. We have removed all the printf statements and replacing them with ShowMessage().
3. The help/usage has been modified.
4. We have modified the logic to calculate the width of the timeout value entered.
5. We have added a function to get the command line arguments.
6. We have added a function to print the output messages.
7. We have moved all the strings to the .rc file.

Note: It is assumed that there are no DCR’s and that the code is working fine.
