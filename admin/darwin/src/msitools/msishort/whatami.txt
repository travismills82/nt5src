this was a dll utility we shipped as a workaround for a problem with 
resolving darwin shortcuts on win9x platforms.  we were either too 
close to shipping or this was right after we shipped for it to make sense
to fix it in msi.dll.  i believe Office picked up this dll.

we should never need to build or modify this again.
