This directory contains tests for code that is internally published in the published\ directory.
Normally these types of unit tests would be located in a subdirectory of the code it tests; in 
this case we do not want to pollute the published directory with files that are not published.

The tests in this directory are:
EncryptedStringTest\			-> tests published\inc\EncryptedString.w (a header file)
