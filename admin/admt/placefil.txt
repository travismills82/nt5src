; This file is used to specify where every file built by the NT build lab is
; binplaced relative to the root of the distribution point.  If a file is not
; listed, it will end up in the dump directory. It also service to indicate which
; files are accompanied by symbols.  And final it serves to inform the internationalization
; team which files are included in this product. The ADMT Post-build script will
; copy and rename this file to 
;
; The format is like this:
;
; <imagename>    <class name>	<symbol location>
;
; where <imagename> is the filename.ext and <class name> is the directory off
; the root of the distribution point (retail is a placeholder for the root).
; If there are multiple class names for a single image, use a colon to separate
; each.
;
