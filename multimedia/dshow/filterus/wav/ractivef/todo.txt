Things that aren't handled yet:
Downloading samples
Selecting GM samples
Better algorithm for stealing voices -- need to at least support
	channel priority per DLS spec.
fractional loop points in sample? (not in Level 1, but easy?)
registered parameter numbers -- esp. pitch bend range
	(look at controllers 96, 97, 100, 101, 6, 38?)

controllers 91 & 93: seem to be used often, should we implement?

assert in Quartz filter when playing Almonds.MID--bad MIDI framing?
	-- havent' seen this lately....

support SYSEX for "hindered MIDI"--ignore channels 13-16 -- done
	in Quartz MIDI source filter, possibly by exposing different
	media subtype for hindered midi files

Ring 0 synth implementation--waiting for George...

Fix attack segment using concave transform

Support for unloading collections, delayed loading of waves from wave pool
instrument locking....


Things done from list:
special-case for drum instrument
	- Done: Seperate place for drum instruments.
All Notes Off correct support
drum instrument off by one
simple version of velocity to volume scaling
16 bit samples & compression to 8 bits.
	- done, but compression algorithm needs work
fix pitch clamping to 24 semitones.
	- Done: Increase range to 48 and drop octave if exceeded.
Ensure compressed samples don't have delta > 128 when loading
	- done, done while compressing
Default pan
	- done, no check that it's only a drum, should there be?
CSourceEG::m_dwVelAttackScale, CSourceEG::m_dwKeyDecayScale
	- done, easy once I realized time cents are a lot like pitch cents....
