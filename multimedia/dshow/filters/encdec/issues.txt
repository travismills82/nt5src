Notes
    05/02   - added EncDec\encdec.inc to control build issues such as turning of DRM - see it
    03/28   - code timebombed since full DRM not in. Need to remove in final shippng stuff..
    03/28   - DRM use turned off (pain to debug with it in) - see flag in encdec.inc
              default to using DogFood XOR encryption
    03/28   - Fast DRM encryption requires a new DrmClien.dll, so turned off by default
              See flag in encdec.inc to turn it on.

Problems
    04/17   - Get Luke to add authentication code into VidControl.
    04/17   - Remove self-authentication code
    04/17   - Need to use Matthij's SBE versions of media subtype/format rather than mine (2 copies of same GUID)
    04/17   - Need to get new DRM licenses for shipping
    04/17   - Need to remove timebomb when everything works
    04/17   - 4 DropQueue threads in VidControl are sort of annoying - any way to have fewer?
    04/13   - support Max ratings for non-freestyle apps (persist most recent max rating?)
    04/15   - methods to override XDSToRat and RatEval CLSID for CoCreate in XDSCodec and Decrypter filters.
    04/10   - methods to extend ratings information over a media sample.
	03/28   - Need private DRMClien.dll to run fast encrypter.  Only one I have is noInt3, so won't publish
    03/28   - no license backup and restore support

    03/28   - consider pulling MSRatings code from the source tree

	03/11	- SYNCRONIZE_BLOCK/DRAIN required in ETFilter/DLL sources files, annoying

To Test/Verify
    04/09   - Rate segment code untested.
    04/08   - Delayed Block-Unrated event untested
    03/27   - need to push methods though the vid control.

Fixed
    04/17   - 04/16   - Possible race condition in the HookupGraphEventService methods
    04/09   - 03/28   - need to put .idl files in correct publish location
    04/05   - 03/27   - no Null renderer-like sample dropping support
    04/05   - 03/28   - no Rate Segment Support - can do trick play with DVR with it (still untested)
    03/27   - need to put in freestyle (XPSP1_Freestyle) branch
    03/27   - no KsProperty support in decrypter filter
    03/25   - no DRM integration
    03/25   - need to finalize the MSRatings format

	03/13	- no XDSCodec filter
	03/13	- do we need to allocate encrypted samples?  (read only media samples?)

	03/12	03/07 - no decoder filter
	03/12	03/07 - no prop pages
	03/11	03/11 - doesn't connect
	03/11	03/11 - multi-process build fails 
	03/11	03/11 - build environment doesn't work
	03/11	03/11 - check into lab01_ private branch

	03/07	- no passing of minor type through format block
	03/07	- no guts - doesn't do anything yet
