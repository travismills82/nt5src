<B><P>What is HyperTerminal Private Edition?</P>
</B></FONT><P>HyperTerminal Private Edition (HyperTerminal PE) is a more powerful version of HyperTerminal, which Microsoft includes with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000. Hilgraeve developed HyperTerminal for Microsoft, and began providing HyperTerminal PE free for personal use shortly after the release of Windows 95. Each successive release of HyperTerminal PE has won new awards and caused the program's following to swell. It is today one of the most popular free downloads on the Internet.</P>

<P>PC Magazine has said, "HyperTerminal Private Edition sets a new standard for what to expect from free software…one of the Internet's best giveaways." You can find excerpts from many other rave reviews and quotes from satisfied HyperTerminal PE users at http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe.html.</P>

<P>HyperTerminal PE is provided free for personal use and at a modest charge for business use (see License Agreement, below). Business users may evaluate the product for a period of 15 days, then purchase individual or site licenses if they wish to continue using it. You can purchase a single-user license for $29.95 by double-clicking the Purchase Private Edition icon in the folder that contains HyperTerminal PE, or use our online order form at http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpeord.html. For site licenses or customized versions, contact sales@hilgraeve.com, call Hilgraeve at 800-826-2760 (US and Canada) or 734-243-0576, or fax 734-243-0645.</P>

<P>You can find additional information about HyperTerminal PE or download the latest version from http://www.hilgraeve.com or the HyperTerminal BBS (734-243-9957 or telnet://htermbbs.hilgraeve.com). HyperTerminal and HyperTerminal PE offer a subset of the capabilities of Hilgraeve's award-winning, full-featured communications program, HyperACCESS. Businesses or individuals who need capabilities beyond those of HyperTerminal PE should consider HyperACCESS.</P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>What is HyperACCESS?</P>
</B></FONT><P>HyperACCESS is the official FULL-POWERED upgrade from HyperTerminal and HyperTerminal PE. It is the product from which HyperTerminal and HyperTerminal PE are derived. HyperACCESS offers a wide array of additional capabilities, with a similar look and feel. HyperACCESS gives you these and many other benefits:</P>


<UL>
<LI>Many additional terminal emulators and file transfer protocols </LI>
<LI>Record and play back logons and repetitive steps with VBS (Visual Basic Script) </LI>
<LI>Redefine keys and add your own buttons to the toolbar with text or bitmap labels </LI>
<LI>Automate communications with Visual Basic, VBA, C++, or other languages </LI></UL>


<P>To learn about the many other advantages of HyperACCESS, browse http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpe.html#benefits.</P>

<P>HyperACCESS has won top awards from every major computer magazine and been selected Editor's Choice of PC Magazine 4 times. The most recent PC Magazine award states, <I>"Terminal communications, whether through Internet telnet connections or plain old telephone lines, has never been done better than by Hilgraeve's HyperACCESS. Elegant, clear menus and tight integration with Windows and the Internet make it our Editor's Choice among the terminal programs we looked at." </I>For excerpts from other reviews of HyperACCESS, go to http://www.hilgraeve.com/hawin32.html#press.</P>

<P>People who use HyperACCESS love it. Here are some quotes from happy customers:</P>


<UL>
<LI>"Everything (!!!!!!) worked exactly as I would want it to work!"</LI>
<LI>"Thank you for another great product! You have once again set a Win95 standard we can use to compare all other "similar but not quite there yet" software."</LI>
<LI>"A most excellent product! If the above doesn't make this clear, I am very, very impressed." T.K.</LI></UL>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>What is DropChute?</P>
</B></FONT>
<P>DropChute is a new product family from Hilgraeve, entirely separate from HyperTerminal or HyperACCESS. It's a revolutionary new kind of software -- personal file delivery software -- the fastest, easiest, most secure way to exchange files with others over the Internet, intranets, or modems. It solves the problems people experience trying to exchange files as email attachments or with ftp.</P>

<P>DropChute lets you:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Deliver files of any kind to any other PC through the Internet, intranets (TCP/IP networks), or by modem, simply by dragging and dropping the files onto that person's icon.</LI>
<LI>DropChute instantly establishes a REAL-TIME connection to the other PC and send files immediately, avoiding the time lag and insecurity of e-mail store-and-forward mechanisms.</LI>
<LI>Send individual files, folders, or entire drives. There is no limit to the size, number, or type of files you can send.</LI>
<LI>Send and receive all data with ironclad error correction, crash recovery and on-the-fly compression, so you can be sure files come through intact, safe, secure, and fast.</LI>
<LI>Exchange files with complete privacy with RSA Public Key Authentication and Symmetric Key Encryption, based on Microsoft Cryptography APIs. No extra manual steps required.</LI>
<LI>Enjoy peace of mind that files are free from more than 6,700 known computer viruses. DropChute detects and blocks viruses in incoming files using IBM virus data.</LI>
<LI>Chat in real-time with the person at the other end before, during or after a file exchange. Attach cover notes to files, for the recipient to read.</LI></UL>


<P>DropChute eliminates problems associated with e-mail attachments, such as security concerns, clogged mail servers, and slow or uncertain delivery. It's easier than ftp and more secure. It exchanges files through a real-time, user-authenticated, encypted connection, so nobody can intercept and decipher the data. And it works through firewalls without breaching security.</P>

<P>For more information about DropChute, or download a trial copy of DropChtue Pro, go to http://www.dropchute.com, call 800-826-2760 (US and Canada) or 734-243-0576, or e-mail sales@hilgraeve.com.</P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>How HyperTerminal PE is Different from HyperTerminal</P>
</B></FONT><P>On the surface, HyperTerminal PE seems identical to HyperTerminal (except for its banner screen). Both are speedy 32-bit programs that take full advantage of the Windows interface and features, such as TAPI (Telephony API) and Unimodem universal modem support. But looks can be deceiving. Each new version of HyperTerminal PE has added new features not in the versions of HyperTerminal that Microsoft provides, and has corrected problems identified after release of HyperTerminal. Sections below list the new features added in each new version of HyperTerminal PE.</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P>HyperTerminal PE 6.0 Enhancements</P>

<UL>

<LI>Includes bug fixes for improved use with all versions of Windows </LI></UL>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial">

<LI>Improved file handling during interrupted transfers, for Zmodem crash recovery </LI>

<LI>Fixed problems that occurred with certain printers </LI>
<LI>Corrected subtle errors in Minitel terminal emulation </LI></UL>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P>Installing and Using HyperTerminal PE</P>
</B></FONT><P>HyperTerminal PE 6.3 is provided as a file called HTPE6.EXE. Simply execute HTPE6.EXE and follow the instructions that display. You can do this by opening the folder that contains HTPE6.EXE and double-clicking on this file, or by selecting Run from the Start menu, browsing to the folder, and selecting this file.</P>

<P>That's it! HyperTerminal PE is now ready to use. You start and use it the same as the HyperTerminal program provided with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000; see your Windows documentation or Help for instructions.</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P>Using HyperTerminal PE as a Telnet Client</P>
</B></FONT><P>Using HyperTerminal PE as a telnet client is simple. You must have TCP/IP installed on your computer first. Once that is done, simply change the "Connect using" setting to "TCP/IP (Winsock)" in HyperTerminal PE's Connect To property sheet, and enter the Host address (either the host name or its numeric IP address and port number). Telnet sites are typically listed in one of the two following forms: </P>
<B><DIR>

<P>Host name:port number </B>or <B>numeric IP address:port number</P>
</B></DIR>

<P>If you enter no port number, HyperTerminal PE assumes you mean port number 23, which is the default port for telnet. If the telnet site you want to reach uses a port other than 23, you will need to enter the port number.</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P>Changing the Redial Delay</P>
</B></FONT><P>You may need to change the redial delay if your country restricts how quickly busy numbers may be redialed. (The US has no restrictions.) The default delay is two seconds. To change the delay, you must change a setting in the Windows registry: </P>

<P>1. Run the Registry Editor. If you don't have a shortcut set up for the Registry Editor, type REGEDIT at a DOS prompt.</P>
<P>2. Open the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE folder by clicking on the plus sign to the left of the folder, or double-click on the folder.</P>
<P>3. Open the SOFTWARE folder and the Microsoft folder that it contains in a similar fashion.</P>
<P>4. Open the HyperTerminal folder contained in the Microsoft folder.</P>
<P>5. Open the TimeToRedial folder contained in the HyperTerminal folder, and a value will appear in the window on the right.</P>
<P>6. Double-click on the (Default) to bring up the Edit String dialog. Enter the new value and click OK.</P>
<P>7. Exit the Registry Editor.</P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P>Using Special Characters</P>
</B></FONT><P>If you find that special characters aren't being sent or displayed correctly by HyperTerminal PE, try changing to a different font. Due to the way Windows maps characters under different fonts, you will see a different character displayed if you are using the Terminal font, as opposed to the other available fonts. There is a more complete discussion of font issues in the FAQs about HyperTerminal PE at http://www.hilgraeve.com/htpefaq.html.</P>
