=head1 NAME

HTML::Tree - overview of HTML::TreeBuilder et al

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use HTML::TreeBuilder;
  my $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder->new();
  $tree->parse_file($filename);
   #
   # Then do something with the tree, using HTML::Element
   # methods -- for example $tree->dump
   #
   # Then:
  $tree->delete;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

HTML-Tree is a suite of Perl modules for making parse trees out of
HTML source.  It consists of mainly two modules, whose documentation
you should refer to: L<HTML::TreeBuilder|HTML::TreeBuilder>
and L<HTML::Element|HTML::Element>.

HTML::TreeBuilder is the module that builds the parse trees.  (It uses
HTML::Parser to do the work of breaking the HTML up into tokens.)

The tree that TreeBuilder builds for you is made up of objects of the
class HTML::Element.

If you find that you do not properly understand the documentation
for HTML::TreeBuilder and HTML::Element, it may be because you are
unfamiliar with tree-shaped data structures, or with object-oriented
modules in general.  I have written some articles for I<The Perl
Journal> (C<www.tpj.com>) that seek to provide that background:
my article "A User's View of Object-Oriented Modules" in TPJ17;
my article "Trees" in TPJ18;
and
my article "Scanning HTML" in TPJ19.
The full text of those articles is contained in this distribution, as:

L<HTML::Tree::AboutObjects|HTML::Tree::AboutObjects>
-- article: "User's View of Object-Oriented Modules"

L<HTML::Tree::AboutTrees|HTML::Tree::AboutTrees>
-- article: "Trees"

L<HTML::Tree::Scanning|HTML::Tree::Scanning>
-- article: "Scanning HTML"

Readers already familiar with object-oriented modules and tree-shaped
data structures should read just the last article.  Readers without
that background should read the first, then the second, and then the
third.
