# Sample sources fine for a single windows apps that depend on several libs.
# The mywin.exe is compiled from source files listed.
# UMENTRY used to overide the standard entry point to winmain.
# It uses the standard MSVCRT libraries.
# Note that the $(SDK_LIB_PATH) macro is used to reference where the standard
# SKD libs are found.  It is defined in the build environment in the
# i386mk.inc file of the tools directory (or ia64mk.inc file).
