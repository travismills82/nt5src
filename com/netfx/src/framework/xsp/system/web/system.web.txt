ASP.NET has a base process identity (typically {MACHINE}\\ASPNET on IIS 5 or Network Service on IIS 6) that is used if the application is not impersonating.  If the application is impersonating via <identity impersonate="true"/>, the identity will be the anonymous user (typically IUSR_MACHINENAME) or the authenticated request user.
Unauthorized_Err_Desc2=To grant ASP.NET write access to a file, right-click the file in Explorer, choose "Properties" and select the Security tab. Click "Add" to add the appropriate user or group. Highlight the ASP.NET account, and check the boxes for the desired access.
Security_Err_Error=Security Exception
Security_Err_Desc=The application attempted to perform an operation not allowed by the security policy.  To grant this application the required permission please contact your system administrator or change the application's trust level in the configuration file.\r\n
NotFound_Resource_Not_Found=The resource cannot be found.
NotFound_Http_404=HTTP 404. The resource you are looking for (or one of its dependencies) could have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.  Please review the following URL and make sure that it is spelled correctly.
NotFound_Requested_Url=Requested Url
Forbidden_Type_Not_Served=This type of page is not served.
Forbidden_Extension_Incorrect=The extension '{0}' may be incorrect.
Forbidden_Extension_Desc=The type of page you have requested is not served because it has been explicitly forbidden.  {0}   Please review the URL below and make sure that it is spelled correctly.
Generic_Err_Title=Runtime Error
Generic_Err_Local_Desc=An application error occurred on the server. The current custom error settings for this application prevent the details of the application error from being viewed.
Generic_Err_Remote_Desc=An application error occurred on the server. The current custom error settings for this application prevent the details of the application error from being viewed remotely (for security reasons). It could, however, be viewed by browsers running on the local server machine.
Generic_Err_Details_Title=Details
Generic_Err_Local_Details_Desc=To enable the details of this specific error message to be viewable on the local server machine, please create a <customErrors> tag within a "web.config" configuration file located in the root directory of the current web application. This <customErrors> tag should then have its "mode" attribute set to "RemoteOnly". To enable the details to be viewable on remote machines, please set "mode" to "Off".
Generic_Err_Remote_Details_Desc=To enable the details of this specific error message to be viewable on remote machines, please create a <customErrors> tag within a "web.config" configuration file located in the root directory of the current web application. This <customErrors> tag should then have its "mode" attribute set to "Off".
Generic_Err_Local_Details_Sample=<!-- Web.Config Configuration File -->\r\n\r\n<configuration>\r\n    <system.web>\r\n        <customErrors mode="RemoteOnly"/>\r\n    </system.web>\r\n</configuration>

Generic_Err_Notes_Title=Notes
Generic_Err_Notes_Desc=The current error page you are seeing can be replaced by a custom error page by modifying the "defaultRedirect" attribute of the application's <customErrors> configuration tag to point to a custom error page URL.
Generic_Err_Local_Notes_Sample=<!-- Web.Config Configuration File -->\r\n\r\n<configuration>\r\n    <system.web>\r\n        <customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="mycustompage.htm"/>\r\n    </system.web>\r\n</configuration>
Generic_Err_Remote_Notes_Sample=<!-- Web.Config Configuration File -->\r\n\r\n<configuration>\r\n    <system.web>\r\n        <customErrors mode="RemoteOnly" defaultRedirect="mycustompage.htm"/>\r\n    </system.web>\r\n</configuration>
WithFile_No_Relevant_Line=[No relevant source lines]
Src_not_available=The source code that generated this unhandled exception can only be shown when compiled in debug mode. To enable this, please follow one of the below steps, then request the URL:\r\n\r\n1. Add a "Debug=true" directive at the top of the file that generated the error. Example:\r\n\r\n   <%@ Page Language="C#" Debug="true" %>\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n2) Add the following section to the configuration file of your application:\r\n\r\n<configuration>\r\n    <system.web>\r\n        <compilation debug="true"/>\r\n    </system.web>\r\n</configuration>\r\n\r\n Note that this second technique will cause all files within a given application to be compiled in debug mode. The first technique will cause only that particular file to be compiled in debug mode.\r\n\r\nImportant: Running applications in debug mode does incur a memory/performance overhead. You should make sure that an application has debugging disabled before deploying into production scenario.
