		<summary>
			<para> For internal use only. This implements a comparison that only
      checks for equalilty, so this should only be used in un-sorted data
      structures like Hastable and ListDictionary. This is a little faster
      than using CaseInsensitiveComparer because it does a strict character by
      character equality check rather than a sorted comparison.
