 <summary>Scalable, multi-thread friendly, L1/L2 cache friendly hashtable.  
     Ported from LKRHash.

     <para>
         Multi-thread friendly - Use of fine-grained syncronization 
         partitioning allows access by multiple threads without serious
         lock contention.
     </para>
     <para>
         L1/L2 cache friendly - see notes on use C++ version for more on
         cache optimization analysis.
     </para>
     <para>
         LinearHashtable grows incrementally, only growing a single 
         bucket at a time.  This allows constant expected lookup instead 
         of large waits when table is rehashed.
