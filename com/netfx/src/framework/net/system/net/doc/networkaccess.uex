		<summary>
   Indicates that the application is allowed to accept
   connections from the Internet on a local resource. Notice that this is a
   protection for the local host that uses Accept to grant access to a local
   resource (address/port). At the time a socket tries to bind
   to this local resource a permission check is performed to see if
   an Accept exists on that resource.

	<doc for="NetworkAccess.Connect">
		<summary>
			<para> Indicates that the application is allowed to connect to 
      specific Internet resources. Notice that, in the case of remote host
      resource, no check is performed to see that Connect permissions exist. This
      is because the port of a connecting remote host is unknown and not
      suitable permissions can be built in advance. It is the application
      responsibility to check the permissions of the remote host trying to connect to a listening socket.
