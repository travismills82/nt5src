			<para>
       A different isolation level than the one specified is being used, but the

		<summary>

       The pending changes from more highly isolated transactions cannot be

	<doc for="IsolationLevel.ReadUncommitted">
		<summary>
			<para>
       A dirty read is possible, meaning that no shared locks are issued and no exclusive locks are honored.
    </para>

	<doc for="IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted">
		<summary>
			<para>
       Shared locks are held while the data is being read to avoid dirty reads, but
       the data can be changed before the end of the transaction, resulting in
       non-repeatable reads or phantom data.
    </para>
		</summary>
	</doc>
	<doc for="IsolationLevel.RepeatableRead">
		<summary>
			<para>
       Locks are placed on all data that is used in a query, preventing other users from updating the data. Prevents non-repeatable reads but phantom rows are still possible.
    </para>

	<doc for="IsolationLevel.Serializable">
		<summary>
			<para> A range lock is placed on the <see cref="System.Data.DataSet"/>, preventing other users from updating or inserting rows into the dataset until the transaction is complete.</para>

		<summary>
			<para> Specifies the transaction locking behavior for the connection.

		<remarks>
			<para> The <see cref="System.Data.IsolationLevel"/> values are used by a .NET Framework data provider when
   performing a transaction.
   </para>
			<para> The <see cref="System.Data.IsolationLevel"/> remains in effect until explicitly changed,
but it can be changed at any time. The new value is used at execution time, not
parse time. If changed during a transaction, the expected behavior of the server
is to apply the new locking level to all statements remaining.</para>
