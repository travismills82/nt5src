			<para>Represents the method that will handle the <see cref="System.Data.OracleClient.OracleDataAdapter.RowUpdating"/>
event of an
<see cref="System.Data.OracleClient.OracleDataAdapter"/>.</para>
		</summary>
		<param name="sender">The source of the event.</param>
		<param name=" e">The <see cref="System.Data.OracleClient.OracleRowUpdatingEventArgs"/> that contains the event data.</param>
		<remarks>
			<para>The handler is not required to perform any action, and your code should avoid generating
      exceptions or allowing exceptions to propagate to the calling method. Any
      exceptions that do reach the caller are ignored.</para>
			<para>The handler may use the <see cref="System.Data.OracleClient.OracleRowUpdatingEventArgs"/> to influence the processing
   of the updates. For example, the handler may opt to skip the update of the
   current row or skip the update of all remaining rows. Note that the rows are
   updated in the order that they were received from the data source.</para>
			<para>When you create an <see cref="System.Data.OracleClient.OracleRowUpdatingEventArgs"/> delegate,
you identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with
your event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The event
handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For
more information about event handler delegates, see <see topic="cpconeventsdelegates"/>.</para>
