   <doc for="PolyFillMode.Alternate">
 <summary>
     When the polygon-filling mode is ALTERNATE, the system fills
     the area between odd-numbered and even-numbered polygon sides on each
     scan line. That is, the system fills the area between the first and
     second side, between the third and fourth side, and so on. This mode
     is the default.

   <doc for="PolyFillMode.Winding">
 <summary>
     When the polygon-filling mode is WINDING, the system uses the
     direction in which a figure was drawn to determine whether to fill an
     area. Each line segment in a polygon is drawn in either a clockwise or
     a counterclockwise direction. Whenever an imaginary line drawn from an
     enclosed area to the outside of a figure passes through a clockwise
     line segment, a count is incremented. When the line passes through a
     counterclockwise line segment, the count is decremented. The area is
     filled if the count is nonzero when the line reaches the outside of
     the figure.

 <summary>
    <para>
       When the polygon-filling mode is WINDING, the system uses the direction in
       which a figure was drawn to determine whether to fill an area. Each line segment
       in a polygon is drawn in either a clockwise or a counterclockwise direction.
       Whenever an imaginary line drawn from an enclosed area to the outside of a
       figure passes through a clockwise line segment, a count is incremented. When the
       line passes through a counterclockwise line segment, the count is decremented.
       The area is filled if the count is nonzero when the line reaches the outside of
       the figure.
