 <summary>
     Enum that defines a set of predefined coordinate systems that
     are available in Win32.

   <doc for="CoordinateSystem.Anisotropic">
 <summary>
     Logical units are mapped to arbitrary units with arbitrarily
     scaled axes. Use the Graphics.setPageExtent and
     Graphics.setDeviceExtent functions to specify the units, orientation,
     and scaling that you want.
 </summary>

   <doc for="CoordinateSystem.HiEnglish">
 <summary>
     Each logical unit is mapped to 0.001 inch. Positive x is to the right; positive
     y is up.
 </summary>
   </doc>
   <doc for="CoordinateSystem.HiMetric">
 <summary>
     Each logical unit is mapped to 0.01 millimeter. Positive x is to the right;
     positive y is up.
 </summary>
   </doc>
   <doc for="CoordinateSystem.Isotropic">
 <summary>
     Logical units are mapped to arbitrary units with equally scaled axes;
     that is, one unit along the x-axis is equal to one unit along the y-axis.
     Use the Graphics.setPageExtent and Graphics.setDeviceExtent
     functions to specify the units and the orientation of the axes that you want.
     Win32 makes adjustments as necessary to ensure the x and y units remain the
     same size (for example, if you set the page extent, the device extent will be
     adjusted to keep the units isotropic).

   <doc for="CoordinateSystem.LoEnglish">
 <summary>
     Each logical unit is mapped to 0.01 inch. Positive x is to the right; positive
     y is up.
 </summary>

   <doc for="CoordinateSystem.LoMetric">
 <summary>
     Each logical unit is mapped to 0.1 millimeter. Positive x is to the right;
     positive y is up.
 </summary>
   </doc>
   <doc for="CoordinateSystem.Text">
 <summary>
     Each logical unit is mapped to one device pixel. Positive x is to the right;
     positive y is down. Because of the left to right, top to botton orientation of
     this coordinate system, it is called text.  This is the default
     coordinate system of a Graphics object.
 </summary>

   <doc for="CoordinateSystem.Twip">
 <summary>
     Each logical unit is mapped to one twentieth of a printer's point
     (1/1440 inch, also called a "twip"). Positive x is to the right;
     positive y is up.
