 <summary>
    Specifies the quality level to use during
    compositing.
 </summary>
 <remarks>
    Compositing is done during rendering when
    the source pixels are combined with the destination pixels to produce the
    resultant pixels. The quality of compositing directly relates to the visual
    quality of the output and is inversely proportional to the render time. The
    higher the quality the slower the render time. This is because the higher the
    quality level, the more surrounding pixels need to be taken into account during
    the composite. The linear quality setting compromises by providing better
    quality than default at a slightly higher cost for performance.
