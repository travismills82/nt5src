			<para>Specifies how the interior of a closed path is filled.</para>

		<remarks>
			<para>An application fills the interior of a path using one of two fill modes:
      alternate or winding. The mode determines how to fill and clip the interior
      of a closed figure.</para>
			<para>The default mode is alternate fill. In the alternate mode, the interiors of
      closed figures are determined as follows: draw a line from any arbitrary start
      point in the path to some point obviously outside of the path. If the line
      crosses an odd number of path segments, the starting point is inside the closed
      region and is therefore part of the fill or clipping area. An even number of
      crossings means that the point is not in an area to be filled. All open figures
      and their segments are ignored and not filled.
      </para>
			<para>The winding mode considers not only the number of times that the vector
      crosses segments of the path, but also considers the direction of each segment.
      Now draw the same arbitrary line described in the alternate path. Starting from
      zero, add one for every "up" direction segment that the line crosses, and
      subtract one for every "down" direction segment crossed. (Up and down directions
      can be arbitrarily chosen.) If the count result is nonzero, then the start point
      is inside the fill or clipping area; a zero count means the point is outside the
      fill or clipping area. The open figures and their segments are ignored and not
      filled.</para>
