		<remarks>
			<para><see cref="System.Web.UI.Design.DataBindingHandler"/> provides a base class for data-binding
   handlers. A data-binding handler can be used within a designer to
   perform data-binding to enable a meaningful display of the control on the design
   surface. Typically a control's designer is responsible for this functionality.
   However, when a control is not live on the design surface, such as within the
   template of another control, it does not have a designer, and this functionality
   is provided by a data-binding handler if one has been specified
   with a <see cref="System.Web.UI.DataBindingHandlerAttribute"/> in the code for the control.
   </para>
			<para> To use
   a data-binding handler, the control which has the data-bound property or
   properties must have a <see cref="System.Web.UI.DataBindingHandlerAttribute"/> specified within
   its code that indicates the type of data-binding handler to use.</para>
			<para>For example, the <see cref="System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label"/> control is associated with the <see cref="System.Web.UI.Design.TextDataBindingHandler"/> class through
a <see cref="System.Web.UI.DataBindingHandlerAttribute"/> in the code
for the <see cref="System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label"/> class. Within a
template for a <see cref="System.Web.UI.WebControls.DataList"/> , a <see cref="System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label"/> control whose text property has been data bound displays
the word "DataBound" on the label. Without the data-binding handler, the label
would be invisible at design-time, as it does not have a designer to bind
its data-bound properties while in a templated control at design-time.</para>
			<para>To implement a data-binding handler, define a new class that derives from
   this class and implement the <see cref="System.Web.UI.Design.DataBindingHandler.DataBindControl"/> method to set the appropriate properties. </para>

		<remarks>
			<para> This method should be implemented in a derived class to provide
      functionality to a custom data-binding handler. The logic for the data binding should
      be implemented within this method, and can be specific to the type or types
      that the data-binding handler is to bind a property or properties on.</para>
			<note type="inotes">
      Most data binding handlers will need to examine the data bindings collection
      on the control, using the <see cref="System.Web.UI.IDataBindingsAccessor"/> interface, to determine if
      any specific properties it can handle are data-bound.
