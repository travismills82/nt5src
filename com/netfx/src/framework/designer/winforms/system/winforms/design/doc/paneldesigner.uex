 <para>Provides design-time functionality for the <see cref='System.Windows.Forms.Panel'/> control.</para>
 </summary>
 <remarks>
    <para>This designer draws a visible border on the panel if it doesn't have a border so 
       the user can determine where the boundaries of the panel are.</para>
 </remarks>
   </doc>
   <doc for="PanelDesigner.DrawBorder">
 <summary>
      This draws a nice border around our panel.  We need
      this because the panel can have no border and you can't
      tell where it is.

    <para>Overrides the OnPaintAdornments method of the base class.</para>
 </summary>
 <remarks>
