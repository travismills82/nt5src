 <remarks>
 <para>When you create a ContainerSelectorActiveEventHandler delegate, you 
    identify the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your
    event-handling method, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The
    event-handling method is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the
    delegate. For more information about event handler delegates, see <see topic='cpconEventsDelegates'/>.</para>
