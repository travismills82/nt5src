       When a component becomes selected, the selection border for
       know what mode a component is in through the use of a different selection
       border. While a component can configure different selection border styles,
       changing a border style does not affect the behavior of the component in the
       designer. Developers must make use of the <see cref='System.ComponentModel.Design.IDesigner'/>
       interface
       to modify the component's behavior when running in a design environment.

       Selection involves an action a user or interface takes to select an object.
       Once the object is selected, the user can specify an action for the object.
       the selection frame that a component uses. This is useful if your component
       supports different modes of operation (such as an in-place editing mode and a
       static design mode). Where possible, leave the selection style as is and use the
       design-time hit testing feature of the <see cref='System.ComponentModel.Design.IDesigner'/> interface to
       provide features at design time. The value of style must be one of
       enum
       values.
