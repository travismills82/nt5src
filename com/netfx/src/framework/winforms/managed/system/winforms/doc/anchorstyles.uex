		<remarks>
			<para>When a control is anchored to an edge of its container, the
      distance between the control and the specified edge remains constant when the
      container resizes. For example, if a control is anchored to the right edge of
      its container, the distance between the right edge of the control and the right
      edge of the container remains constant when the container resizes. A control
      can be anchored to any combination of control edges. If the control is
      anchored to opposite edges of its container (for example, to the top and
      bottom), it resizes when the container resizes. If a control has its <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor"/> property set to
   <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.AnchorStyles.None" qualify="true"/>, the control moves half of the distance that
      the container of the control is resized. For example, if a <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.Button"/> has its <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor"/> property set to <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.AnchorStyles.None" qualify="true"/> and the <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.Form"/>
      that the control is located
      on is resized by 20 pixels in either direction, the button will be
      moved 10 pixels in both directions.</para>

		<example>
			<para>The following example adds a <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.Button"/> to a form and sets some of its common properties. The example anchors the button to the bottom-right corner of the form so it keeps its relative position as the form is resized. Next it sets the <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage"/> and resizes the button to the same size as the <see cref="System.Drawing.Image"/> . The example then sets the <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.Control.TabStop"/> to <see langword="true "/>and sets the <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.Control.TabIndex"/> property. Lastly, it adds an event handler to handle the <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click"/> event of the button. This example assumes you have an <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.ImageList"/> named <c>imageList1</c>.</para>
