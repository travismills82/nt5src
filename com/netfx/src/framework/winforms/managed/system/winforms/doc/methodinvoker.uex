    <para> Represents the method that handles the 
    <see langword='Invoke '/> event for a method.</para>
 </summary>
 <remarks>
 <para><see cref='System.Windows.Forms.MethodInvoker'/> 
 provides a simple delegate that is used to invoke
 a method with a void parameter list. This delegate can be used when making calls to a
 control's invoke method, or when you need a simple delegate but don't want to
 define one yourself.</para>
 <para>When you create a <see cref='System.Windows.Forms.MethodInvoker'/> delegate, you identify the method that
 will handle the event. To associate the event with your event handler, add
 an instance of the delegate to the event. The event handler is
 called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the delegate. For more
 information about event-handler delegates, see <see topic='cpconEventsDelegates'/>.</para>
