		<remarks>
			<para>When a control is docked to an edge of its container, it is always positioned
      flush against that edge when the container is resized. If more than one control
      is docked to an edge, the controls appear side by side according to their
      z-order; controls higher in the z-order are positioned farther from the
      container's edge.</para>
			<para>If <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Left"/>, <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Right"/>, <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Top"/>, or <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Bottom"/> is selected, the specified and opposite
   edges of the control are resized to the size of the containing control's
   corresponding edges. If <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Fill"/> is selected, all four sides of the control
   are resized to match the containing control's edges.</para>

		<example>
			<para>The following example creates a <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox"/> and sets some of its common properties. The example creates a <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.TextBox"/> and sets its <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location"/> within the group box. Next, it sets the <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text"/> property of the group box, and docks the group box to the top of the form. Lastly, it disables the group box by setting the <see cref="System.Windows.Forms.Control.Enabled"/> property to <see langword="false"/>, which causes all controls contained within the group box to be disabled. </para>
