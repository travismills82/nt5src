			<para><see cref="System.ComponentModel.Design.ServiceCreatorCallback"/>
provides a mechanism to publish services that you can request to have
created when needed, rather than the service being created immediately when the designer
loads. You can use a callback function if the service is not essential
and may not be used. A service published by using a <see cref="System.ComponentModel.Design.ServiceCreatorCallback"/>
does not use
as many additional resources if it is not requested and created. To use a callback function
to publish your service, pass a <see cref="System.ComponentModel.Design.ServiceCreatorCallback"/> to the <see cref="System.ComponentModel.Design.IServiceContainer.AddService"/> method of an <see cref="System.ComponentModel.Design.IServiceContainer"/>.</para>
