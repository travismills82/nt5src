			<para> Components of a designer document can be selected using the <see cref="System.ComponentModel.Design.ISelectionService.SetSelectedComponents"/>
method of
the <see cref="System.ComponentModel.Design.ISelectionService"/>
. Some types of actions can operate on a selected component or group of selected
components. The <see cref="System.ComponentModel.Design.ISelectionService"/>
keeps track of the selection type
of the current selection. These selection type identifiers indicate whether the selection was completed
using a single click, a mouse down or mouse up selection, whether the selection should replace the previous selection, or use
the default selection mode.</para>
			<para> Use the <see cref="System.ComponentModel.Design.SelectionTypes"/> enumeration to specify the type of
a selection when setting a new selection using the <see cref="System.ComponentModel.Design.ISelectionService.SetSelectedComponents"/>
method.</para>
