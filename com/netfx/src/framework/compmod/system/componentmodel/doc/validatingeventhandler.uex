		<remarks>
			<para>When you create a ValidatingEventHandler delegate, you identify
      the method that will handle the event. To associate the event with your
      event handler, add an instance of the delegate to the event. The
      event handler is called whenever the event occurs, unless you remove the
      delegate. For more information about event handler delegates, see <see topic="cpconEventsDelegates"/>.
