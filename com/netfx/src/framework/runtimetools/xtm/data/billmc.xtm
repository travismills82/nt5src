        Table/Class properties. Including: name, members, types, etc. Implemented
        in a COM+ object that our non-COM+ object model can talk to.

        Relationship properties. (if field name/type matches, default to auto-join).
        Implemented in a COM+ object that our non-COM+ object model can talk to.
        <progress milestone='m2' week='9' spent='0d'>
          made COM-based property page -- will port to COM+ when we have a COM+ object
          model.

      <task name='Wire visual objects to object model objects' milestone='m2' cost='4d' status='done' priority='1' added='erickn@2/24/99@12:06:41 PM'>
        establish communication between the visual grid object &amp; the underlying
        object model objects the grid represents. This includes supporting bitmaps
        in the row selector column, dropdowns and table names.
        <progress milestone='m2' week='8' spent='4d'>
          Our visual grid now uses object-model to draw its info -- meaning the grid
          has only UI intelligence. It has no inherent knowledge of the designer&apos;s
          behavior.

      <task name='Create Relationships' milestone='m2' cost='2d' status='done' priority='1' added='erickn@2/24/99@12:07:43 PM'>
        Allow the creation of relationships by enabling a command that will bring
        up a dialog or property page to gather all necessary info for a relationship
        and then use that info to create the relationship (in the visible drawing
        as well as in the object model).
        <progress milestone='m2' week='9' spent='2d'>
          can now create relationships in the COM-based object model &amp; in the
          UI.

        have one visible object that represents multiple objects (one grid is one
        table + one adapter).
