		<remarks>
			<para> The <see cref="System.Messaging.Acknowledgment"/> class defines the types of acknowledgment messages Message Queuing
   posts in the administration queue and the conditions that cause
   an acknowledgment message to be sent. Acknowledgment types can be
   divided broadly into four groups: positive arrival acknowledgments, positive read
   acknowledgments, negative arrival acknowledgments, and negative read
   acknowledgments.</para>
			<note type="note">
   The administration queue associated with
   message is specified in the <see cref="System.Messaging.Message.AdministrationQueue" qualify="true"/> property.
</note>
			<para> Message Queuing sets the <see cref="System.Messaging.Message.Acknowledgment" qualify="true"/> property
to one of the <see cref="System.Messaging.Acknowledgment"/>
enumeration values when it creates an acknowledgment message. The <see cref="System.Messaging.Message.Acknowledgment" qualify="true"/> property value is
typically meaningful only when the instance refers to a system-sent
acknowledgment message. Reading the <see cref="System.Messaging.Message.Acknowledgment" qualify="true"/> property
for a message other than an acknowledgment message throws an exception.</para>
			<para> Message Queuing does not send an acknowledgment message
   unless the sending application requests that it do so. Your application makes
   this request by setting the appropriate value for
   the <see cref="System.Messaging.Message.AcknowledgeType" qualify="true"/> property. Message
   Queuing sends all acknowledgment messages to the administration queue
   specified in the <see cref="System.Messaging.Message.AdministrationQueue"/>
   property of the original <see cref="System.Messaging.Message"/>
   . </para>
		</remarks>
		<example>
			<para>The following example sends and receives a message containing an order to and 
      from a queue. It specifically requests a positive acknowledgment when the
      original message reaches or is retrieved from the queue.</para>
