		<summary>
			<para> No authentication is performed. The providers may attempt to bind a client as an
 anonymous user to the targeted object. The WinNT provider does not support this
 flag. Active Directory establishes a connection between the client and the
 targeted object, but does not perform any authentication. Setting this flag
 amounts to requesting an unsecured binding, which means "Everyone" as the
 security context.</para>

		<summary>
			<para>Requests secure authentication. When this flag is set,
      the WinNT provider uses NTLM to authenticate the client. Active Directory uses
      Kerberos, and possibly NTLM, to authenticate the client. When the user name and
      password are <see langword="null"/>, ADSI binds to the object using the security context of the calling thread, which is either the security context of
      the user account under which the application is running or of the client
      user account that the calling thread is impersonating.</para>

		<summary>
			<para> For a WinNT provider, ADSI tries to connect to a primary domain controller (PDC)
      or a backup domain controller (BDC). For Active Directory, this flag indicates
      that a writable server is not required for a serverless binding.</para>

	</doc><doc for="AuthenticationTypes.FastBind">
		<summary>
			<para> ADSI does not attempt to query the Active Directory objectClass property and
      thus only exposes the base interfaces supported by all ADSI objects instead of
      the full object support. A user can use this option to boost the performance in
      a series of object manipulations that involve only methods of the base interfaces.
      However, ADSI does not verify if any of the request objects actually exist
      on the server. For more information, see "Fast Binding Options for Batch Write/Modify
      Operations" in the Active Directory Programmer's Guide.</para>

			<para> If your ADsPath includes a
      server name, specify this flag when using the LDAP provider. Do not use this flag for paths
      that include a domain name or for serverless paths. Specifying a server name without also specifying
      this flag results in unnecessary network traffic.</para>

			<para> Serverless binding refers to a process in which
   a client attempts to bind to an Active Directory object without explicitly
   specifying an Active Directory server in the binding string,
   forexample,LDAP://CN=jsmith,DC=fabrikam,DC=Com. This is possible because the
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) provider relies
   on the locator services of Windows 2000 to find the best domain controller (DC)
   for the client. However, the client must have an account on the Active Directory
   domain controller in order to take advantage of the serverless binding feature, and the domain controller used by a
   serverless bind will always be located in the default domain (the domain
   associated with the current security context of the thread that's doing the
   binding).</para>
			<note type="note">
   None of these options are supported by the Novell
   Netware Directory Service (NDS) system provider.
