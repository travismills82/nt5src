      The threads of a process
      with <see cref="System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass.RealTime"/> priority preempt the threads of all other
      processes, including operating system processes performing important tasks.
      Thus, a <see cref="System.Diagnostics.ProcessPriorityClass.RealTime"/> priority process that executes for more than a
      very brief interval can cause disk caches not to flush or cause the mouse to be
      unresponsive.

      Use extreme care when specifying

		</summary>
		<remarks>
			<para>A process priority class encompasses a range of thread
      priority levels. Threads with different priorities running in the process run
      relative to the process's priority class. The operating system uses the
      base-priority level of all executable threads to determine which thread gets the
      next slice of processor time.</para>
			<para>Win32 uses four priority classes with seven base
      priority levels per class. Based on time elapsed or other boosts, the operating
      system can change the base priority level when a process needs to be put
      ahead of others for access to the processor. In addition, you can set <see cref="System.Diagnostics.Process.PriorityBoostEnabled"/> to
      temporarily boost the priority level
      of threads that have been taken out of the wait state. The priority is reset
      when the process returns to the wait state.</para>
