			<para>The normal, visible window style. The system displays a 
 window with <see langword="Normal"/> style on the screen, in
 a default location. If a window is visible, the user can supply input to the
 window and view the window's output. Frequently, an application may initialize a
 new window to the <see langword="Hidden"/> style while it customizes the window's
 appearance, and then make the window style <see langword="Normal"/>

		<summary>
			<para>The hidden window style. A window can be either visible 
 or hidden. The system displays a hidden window by not drawing it. If a
 window is hidden, it is effectively disabled. A hidden window can process
 messages from the system or from other windows, but it cannot process input from
 the user or display output. Frequently, an application may keep a new
 window hidden while it customizes the window's appearance, and then make the
 window style <see langword="Normal"/>

		<summary>
			<para>The maximized window style. By default, the system
 enlarges a maximized window so that it fills the screen or, in the case of a
 child window, the parent window's client area. If the window has a title bar,
 the system automatically moves it to the top of the screen or to the top of the
 parent window's client area. Also, the system disables the window's sizing
 border and the window-positioning capability of the title bar so that the user
 cannot move the window by dragging the title bar.</para>
