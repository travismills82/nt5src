 <summary>
    <para>
       Generates a hash code for this LocalToken instance.

 <returns>
    <para>
       Returns the hash code for this instance.
    </para>
 </returns>
 <remarks>
    <para>
       The hash code is generated by multiplying the index of this LocalToken
       by the sync block index of the Type object that represents the type of
       this local variable. The index of the LocalToken is assigned by the MethodBuilder
       that declared it. The sync block index is obtained via Object.Equals.
       The hash code is therefore not necessarily unique, even for the local variables
       of a single MethodBuilder.

   <doc for="LocalToken.Equals">
 <summary>
    <para>Checks if the given object is an instance of LocalToken
       and is equal to this instance.</para>
 </summary>
 <param name='obj'>The object to compare to this object..</param>
 <returns>
 <para>Returns <see langword='true'/> if <paramref name="obj"/> is an instance of <see langword='LocalToken'/> 
 and equals the current instance. Otherwise, returns
 <see langword='false'/> 
 .</para>
 </returns>
 <remarks>
    <para>Two LocalToken objects are equal if they have the same
       index and represent local variables that have the same type. The index of the LocalToken
       is assigned by the MethodBuilder that declared it</para>
