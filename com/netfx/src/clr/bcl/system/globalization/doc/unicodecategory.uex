            <para>Defines the Unicode category of a character.</para>
        </summary>
        <remarks>
            <para>The Unicode Standard defines the following:</para>
            <para>A surrogate pair is a coded character representation for a single abstract character that consists of a sequence of two code units,
      where the first unit of the pair is a high-surrogate and the second is a low-surrogate.
      A high-surrogate is a Unicode code point in the range U+D800 through U+DBFF
      and a low-surrogate is a Unicode code point in the range U+DC00 through U+DFFF.</para>
            <para>A combining character sequence is a combination of a base character and one or more combining characters.
      A surrogate pair can represent a base character or a combining character.
      A combining character can be spacing or nonspacing.
      A spacing combining character takes up a spacing position by itself, when rendered;
      whereas, a nonspacing combining character does not.
      Diacritics are an example of nonspacing combining characters.</para>
            <para>A modifier letter is a free-standing spacing character that, like a combining character, indicates modifications of a preceding letter.</para>
            <para>An enclosing mark is a nonspacing combining character that surrounds all previous characters up to and including a base character.</para>
            <para>A format character is a character that is not normally rendered but that affects the layout of text or the operation of text processes.</para>
            <para>The Unicode Standard defines several variations to some punctuation marks.
      For example, a hyphen can be one of several code values that represent a hyphen,
      such as U+002D (hyphen-minus) or U+00AD (soft hyphen) or U+2010 (hyphen) or U+2011 (nonbreaking hyphen).
      The same is true for dashes, space characters, and quotation marks.</para>
            <para>The Unicode Standard also assigns codes to representations of decimal digits that are specific to a given script or language;
      for example, U+0030 (digit zero) and U+0660 (Arabic-Indic digit zero).</para>
            <para>This enumeration is based on The Unicode Standard, Version 3.1.</para>
            <para>For more information, see The Unicode Standard at http://www.unicode.org.</para>
            <para>This enumeration is used to support <see cref="System.Char" /> methods, such as <see langword="IsUpper" />.</para>
