      When you override this
      method and the object returned is a stream, it is assumed to be serialized and
      is compared directly to the serialized form of the evidence used to create existing stores.
      If the object returned is a string, it is considered the name
      of an isolated store and compared to the names of the existing
      stores.

      You typically call this
      method if you are writing a class derived from isolated storage and you need to
      check to see if isolated storage already exists for the current assembly.

		<summary>
			<para>Enables comparisons between an isolated store and an application domain and assembly's evidence.</para>
		</summary>
		<remarks>
			<para> Isolated storage uses evidence about an assembly in order
      to identify it and provide it with a unique file storage location. When an assembly
      requests a store, its evidence (as presented by the host that loaded
      it) is processed and compared with the evidence used to create the
      existing stores. This determines if you need to create a new store or if one
      already exists for the assembly in question. Due to the comparison technique
      used, pieces of evidence that are functionally equivalent might not result in a true
      comparison if the serialized forms are not identical. When implementing custom
      evidence, consider whether this is the case for your evidence class and, if so,
      implement <see cref="System.IO.IsolatedStorage.INormalizeForIsolatedStorage"/>. For evidence that implements this
      interface, the <see cref="System.IO.IsolatedStorage.INormalizeForIsolatedStorage.Normalize"/>
      
      method is called and comparisons are based on
      the normalized copy of the object returned by that method. </para>
			<note type="inotes">
      Implement this interface when you are implementing
      custom evidence and need to determine if a store already exists. Serialized
      objects should not be used for comparisons in some instances, such as that of case sensitive
      strings. For example, www.MSN.com is equal to WWW.msn.com and will return a
   <see langword="true"/> when compared.
      
      To create an
   <see cref="System.IO.IsolatedStorage.INormalizeForIsolatedStorage"/> object, you need to implement the
   <see cref="System.IO.IsolatedStorage.INormalizeForIsolatedStorage.Normalize"/>
   method.
</note>
			<note type="cnotes">
   Call the methods of this interface to normalize the instance before making comparisons between
   an
   assembly's evidence and currently existing
   isolated stores.
