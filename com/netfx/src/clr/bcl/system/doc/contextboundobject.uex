		<remarks>
			<para> Objects that reside in a context and are bound to
      the context rules are called context-bound objects. A context is a set of
      properties or usage rules that define an environment where a collection of objects
      resides. The rules are enforced when the objects are entering or leaving a
      context. Objects that are not context-bound are
      called agile objects.</para>
			<para> Contexts are created during object activation. A new 
      object is placed into an existing context or into a new context created using
      the attributes included in the metadata of the type. Context-bound classes are marked with a <see langword="ContextAttribute"/>
      that provides the usage rules. The context properties that can be added include
      policies regarding synchronization and transactions.</para>
