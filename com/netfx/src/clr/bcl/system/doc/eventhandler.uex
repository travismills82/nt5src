		<summary>
			<para>Represents the method that will handle the event that has no event data.</para>
		</summary>
		<param name="sender">The source of the event.</param>
		<param name="e">An <see cref="System.EventArgs"/> that contains the event data.</param>
		<remarks>
			<para>The event model in the .NET Framework is based on having
 an event delegate that connects an event with its handler. To raise an
 event, two elements are needed:</para>
			<list type="bullet"><item>
					<term>
 
 A class that holds the event data. This class must
 derive from the base class <see cref="System.EventArgs"/>.</term>
				</item>
			</list>
			<list type="bullet"><item>
					<term>
 
 A delegate that points to a method
 that provides the response to the event.</term>
				</item>
			</list>
			<para>If the event does not generate data, use the base
 class <see cref="System.EventArgs"/> for the event data object, and the pre-defined <see cref="System.EventHandler"/> for the event delegate.</para>
			<para>When you create an <see cref="System.EventHandler"/> delegate, you identify the method that will handle the
event. To associate the event with your event handler, add an instance of the
delegate to the event. The event handler is called whenever the event occurs,
unless you remove the delegate. For more information about event handler
delegates, see <see topic="cpconEventsDelegates"/>.</para>
		</remarks>
		<example>
			<para>A declaration for a no-data event delegate is shown below,
 where <see cref="System.EventHandler"/>
 is the pre-defined event delegate, <paramref name="sender"/> is the object
 that raises the event, and <paramref name="e"/> is the event data object that contains no data. The
 second line defines the event member in your class for the no-data event.
