		<remarks>
			<para>Some types of evidence have a corresponding identity permission that is
      granted to assemblies with that evidence. This allows other code to make
      identity demands, so that only code with a specific piece of evidence will
      pass. For example, you can demand that your callers have a specific
      strong name; only callers with that strong name will pass the demand. By
      implementing <see cref="System.Security.Policy.IIdentityPermissionFactory"/> for an evidence object,
      you provide an implementation of <see cref="System.Security.Policy.IIdentityPermissionFactory.CreateIdentityPermission"/> that the
      .NET Framework security system can call to get an identity permission that
      represents that piece of evidence. During policy resolution, the security system
      will call that method on all evidence objects that implement <see cref="System.Security.Policy.IIdentityPermissionFactory"/> and grant the resulting identity
      permissions to the appropriate assembly.</para>
