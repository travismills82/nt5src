		<remarks>
			<para>This delegate is called to create a COM object as an
      alternative to <see langword="CoCreateInstance "/>when a
      managed object needs to create a new
      instance of its unmanaged portion. The <see langword="IUnknown "/>
      of the managed object is passed as a parameter and the delegate should return
      the <see langword="IUnknown "/> of the unmanaged object.
      Both interfaces are passed as type <see cref="System.IntPtr"/>
      to avoid marshaling.</para>
			<para>Every derived class of <see cref="System.Delegate"/> and <see cref="System.MulticastDelegate"/> have a
   constructor and an <see langword="Invoke "/>
   method.</para>
