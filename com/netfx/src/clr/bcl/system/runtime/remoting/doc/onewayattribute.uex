			<para>Marks a method as one way, without a return value and <see langword="out "/>or
<see langword="ref"/> parameters.</para>
		</summary>
		<remarks>
			<para> When one-way methods are invoked, no reply message or status or information is expected. The <see cref="System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.OneWayAttribute"/> is used to indicate that the
   method has a <see langword="void"/> return and only <see langword="in"/>
   parameters. The method is cannot throw any exceptions,
   and <see langword="ref"/> parameters
   and <see langword="return"/> values are not supported. The method can
   execute synchronously or asynchronously with respect to the caller. The caller
   cannot make assumptions that the one-way call has executed on the server object
   when thread control returns.</para>
