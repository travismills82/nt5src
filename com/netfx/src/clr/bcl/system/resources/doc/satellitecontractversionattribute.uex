		<summary>
			<para>Instructs the <see cref="System.Resources.ResourceManager"/> to ask for a particular version of a satellite
   assembly
   to simplify
   updates of the main assembly of an application.</para>
		</summary>
		<remarks>
			<para>The <see cref="System.Resources.SatelliteContractVersionAttribute"/> establishes a contract between a
   main assembly and all its satellites. When the <see cref="System.Resources.ResourceManager"/>
   looks
   up resources, it explicitly loads the satellite version specified
   by this attribute on the main assembly, allowing a layer of
   indirection to facilitate versioning scenarios.</para>
			<para>When the main assembly is updated, its assembly version number is incremented. However, you might not
   want to ship new copies of your satellite assemblies if the existing ones are
   sufficient and compatible with the newer version of your product. In this case,
   increment the main assembly's version number but leave the satellite contract
   version number the same. The <see cref="System.Resources.ResourceManager"/>
   
   will
   use your existing satellite assemblies.</para>
			<para> If you need to revise a satellite assembly but not the main assembly, you must increment
   the version number on your satellite. In this case, ship a policy assembly
   along with your satellite assembly stating that your new satellite assembly has
   backward compatibility with your old satellite assembly. The <see cref="System.Resources.ResourceManager"/>
   
   will still use
   the old contract number written into your main assembly; however, the
   loader will bind to the satellite assembly version as specified by the
   policy assembly.</para>
			<para> A publisher policy assembly is the way in which a vendor of
   a shared component makes a compatibility statement about a particular version
   of a released assembly. A publisher policy assembly is a strongly named
   assembly with a name in the format <c>policy.&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;ComponentAssemblyName&gt;</c>,
and is
registered in the <see topic="cpconglobalassemblycache"/> (GAC). The publisher policy is
generated from an XML configuration file (see <see topic="gngrfbindingredirect"/>) by using
the <see topic="cpgrfassemblygenerationutilityalexe"/> tool. The assembly
linker is used with the <see langword="/link "/> option to
link the XML configuration file to a manifest assembly, that is then stored
in the GAC. The publisher policy assemblies can be used when a vendor ships a maintenance
release (Service Pack) that contains bug fixes. </para>
			<note type="note">
   Apply this attribute to your main
   assembly, passing it the version number of the satellite assembly that will work
   with this version of the main assembly.
