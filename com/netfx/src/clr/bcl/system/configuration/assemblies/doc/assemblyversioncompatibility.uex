			<para><see langword="AssemblyVersionCompatibility "/>defines the compatibility of an assembly
   with other versions of the same assembly, indicating if it cannot execute
   side-by-side with other versions (for example, due to conflicts over a device
   driver).</para>
			<para>If no compatibility is specified, an assembly is side-by-side compatible in
   all scopes.</para>
			<para>An assembly cannot be more specific with regard to exactly which previous
   versions it is not side-by-side compatible with. Therefore, if the
<see langword="AssemblyVersionCompatibility"/> is specified, it means the
   assembly is non side-by-side with all know versions. If not specified, it means
   it is side-by-side with all known versions.</para>
