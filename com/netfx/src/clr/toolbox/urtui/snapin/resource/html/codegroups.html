Security policy is configured using a hierarchy of code groups at every 
policy level. Default security policy consists of union code groups, which combine the permissions of all matching child code groups with their own 
permissions, and some custom code groups.  Every union code group has a 
membership condition and a permission set. If an assembly's evidence matches 
the membership condition on such a code group, the associated permission 
set is granted to the assembly at that policy level. If more than one union 
code group matches, the combination of their permission sets is granted.<br>
      <br>
     A union code group can have zero or more child code groups.  A child 
code group contributes to the permission set granted for an assembly only when both its 
own and its parent code group's membership conditions are met.  If a 
code group's membership condition fails to match the evidence, any child code 
groups will be ignored.<br>
      <br>
      Custom code groups have specialized behavior defined by the code group 
developer and might or might not follow the behavior outlined above. Custom code 
groups cannot be directly edited using this tool.</font></h3>
