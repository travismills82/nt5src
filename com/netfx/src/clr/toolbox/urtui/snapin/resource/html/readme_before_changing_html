There are a couple steps that must be completed when modifying these HTML files.

First, in addition to modifying the HTML file, you'll also have to 
checkout/modify mscorcfghtml.resx.

To modify the resx file, do the following.....

After you've made changes to the HTML file, compile GenResX.cs

csc GenResX.cs /r:System.Windows.Forms.dll

Then run GenHtmlResX.bat.

This will create the new ResX file.

If you add a new HTML file, make sure to update GenHTMLResX.bat.
