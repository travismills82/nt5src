Wrn_ComRegFuncOnNonPublicType = Type '{0}' has a ComRegisterFunction which will not be called since the type is not being registered
Wrn_ComUnRegFuncOnNonPublicType = Type '{0}' has a ComUnregisterFunction which will not be called since the type is not being registered
Wrn_ComTypelibNotUnregistered = Type library not unregistered since the assembly was imported from COM
Wrn_NoRegScriptGenerated = No registry script will be produced since there are no types to register

Wrn_CodeBaseWithNoStrongName = Registering an unsigned assembly with /codebase can cause your assembly to interfere with other applications that may be installed on the same computer. The /codebase switch is intended to be used only with signed assemblies. Please give your assembly a strong name and re-register it.
